The move, seen as part of RBI measures to support growth, comes on the back of the central bank easing loans for microfinance and finance companies.\nAs part of these liquidity efforts, RBI will conduct open market operations to purchase govt bonds worth Rs 1 lakh crore, with two separate auctions of Rs 50,000 crore each scheduled for March 12 and March 18. Additionally, RBI will conduct a buy/sell swap auction for $10 billion, which will have a tenor of 36 months, on March 24. The swap (where RBI buys dollars with an agreement to reverse the sale at predetermined price after three years) will result in a Rs 87,000-crore liquidity infusion.\nThese liquidity measures come ahead of a significant outflow from the markets due to advance tax payments. \"The ides of March (March 15) are when the money markets see the worst liquidity crunch due to advance tax outflows,\" said a bond dealer. The infusion of liquidity is expected to ease some of the pressures on the banking system.\nRBI has assured that it will continue to monitor evolving liquidity and market conditions and take necessary measures to ensure orderly liquidity conditions. RBI reduced interest rates by 25 basis points on Feb 6, marking its first rate cut in five years, as part of ongoing efforts to enhance liquidity in the bond markets.\nOn Feb 28, RBI had conducted a dollar/rupee swap worth $10 billion to inject long-term liquidity into the system, which attracted robust demand.\nAs of March 4, Indian banks' liquidity deficit stood at Rs 20,420 crore, the lowest level since Dec 15.\nLower rates and easier liquidity will help in bank credit growth which has slowed down to 11.2% in Dec. India's economy grew by 6.2% in the Dec quarter, driven by increased govt and consumer spending. Since mid-Jan, the central bank has infused over Rs 4.5 lakh crore into the system, including about Rs 1.4 lakh crore in bond purchases, around Rs 1.3 lakh crore via foreign exchange swaps, and Rs 1.8 lakh crore through early April-maturity repo auctions. The measures are expected to have a positive impact on the bond market and the rupee, with forward premiums likely to fall.", "text_len": 2353}

This suggests that additional liquidity measures may be required on a sustained basis.\nIt said \"Liquidity Estimation; CRR cut is necessary to ease the pressure, RBI could look into using CRR more as a regulatory intervention tool / countercyclical liquidity buffer rather than as a liquidity tool in future\".\nAccording to the report, RBI should explore using CRR more as a regulatory intervention tool or a countercyclical liquidity buffer, rather than relying on it as a liquidity tool in future.\nThe current liquidity conditions, combined with the projected OMO gap, underline the necessity of proactive measures to maintain stability in the financial system.\nThe report also called for a reassessment of RBI's existing liquidity management framework. It suggested replacing the Weighted Average Call Rate (WACR) as the policy rate, arguing that it does not effectively serve its intended purpose.\nThe current framework, according to the report, may need modifications to align with evolving market conditions and liquidity requirements.\nThe Indian banking system's liquidity has seen its worst liquidity crunch of more than a decade. The system liquidity moved from a surplus of Rs 1.35 lakh crore in November to a deficit of Rs 0.65 lakh crore in December, further to Rs 2.07 lakh crore deficit in January and Rs 1.59 lakh crore in February.\nAdditionally, the report pointed out an inadvertent cash leakage due to Mahakumbh, a major religious event.\nThe report says that during Mahakumbh a significant portion of cash withdrawals were made by retail depositors, whereas fresh deposit accretions have come from non-retail participants.\nAs a result, a substantial part of the withdrawn currency may not return to systemic deposits, at least until the end of March.\nWith these factors in mind, the report highlighted the urgency for RBI to take proactive steps to address liquidity concerns. A CRR cut, it said, would provide immediate relief and help stabilize banking system liquidity, ensuring smoother financial operations in the coming months.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 2612}

Improving cash conditions will help in better transmission of interest-rate cuts and support the economy as it heads for its slowest expansion in four years.\nAlso Read: Leeway on easier money could be a hidden peril in India's growth story\n“The RBI’s latest measures indicate that its focus is on making system liquidity positive to enable transmission of rate cuts,” said Gaura Sen Gupta, chief economist, IDFC First Bank Ltd. There will likely be a liquidity surplus by March-end, she said, adding the RBI has room to pump in 2 trillion rupees of cash in the fiscal year starting April 1.\nIndia’s liquidity deficit widened partly due to dollar sales by the central bank to shield the rupee from global headwinds as the local currency hit successive lows. The banking system is now bracing for cash outflows due to quarterly advance tax payments by companies to the government before the financial year-end in March.\nThe measures taken by the RBI this year to provide cash to lenders include auction-based open market bond purchases, variable rate repurchase operations and foreign exchange swaps. It will buy more bonds this month and conduct a forex swap.\nThe cash infusions have helped bring banks’ overnight borrowing rate to below the policy rate in the last couple of days, while two-year government bond yields have eased. The overnight rate was almost 40 basis points above the RBI’s policy rate in early January.\nThe additional measures announced by the central bank this week were “far more in size” than market expectations, Suyash Choudhary, head of fixed income at Bandhan AMC Ltd., wrote in a note. This suggests that the RBI will inject more funds if liquidity conditions do not ease as expected, he said.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 2485}

As per existing norms, credit enhancement can be provided by the financial institutions for only up to 20% of the bond issue size.\n“There has been multiple communications between the RBI and NaBFID regarding partial credit enhancement facility and an encouraging sign is that there is no major objection from the banking sector regulator to it,” said a source.\nFinance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her last Budget speech that NaBFID will set up a partial credit enhancement facility for corporate bonds in the infrastructure sector. The objective behind partial credit enhancement facility is to enhance the credit rating of the bonds issued so as to enable corporates to access the funds from the bond market on better terms.\nNaBFID has also requested the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to reduce risk weight requirements. As per current norms, even if an entity is providing credit enhancement for 20% of the bond issue size, the exposure of the guaranteeing entity will be treated for the entire 100% bond size. NaBFID has requested the RBI to keep risk weights equal to the level of exposure of the guaranteeing entity. The RBI had first allowed banks to provide partial credit enhancement to bonds issued by corporate entities and special purpose vehicles for funding projects in 2015. But this product could not become popular due to the 20% cap on credit enhancement.\nMarket participants say that due to the cap, the savings from rating upgrade due to credit enhancement is not significantly higher than the premium a company currently pays to the guaranteeing entity. NaBFID is expected to launch its new partial credit enhancement facility from next month. This facility will help lower-rated companies lower their cost of borrowing by getting rating upgrade to their bond issuances.\nThe credit enhancement facility contributes to the overall development of the corporate bond market by encouraging more issuers to raise funds through bonds rather than relying solely on bank loans. The bond market is dominated by highly rated issuers. At present, around 75% of bond issuers are rated AAA, and more than 90% of the issuances are by entities rated AA and above.", "text_len": 2401}

The OMO auctions will follow Rs 1.4 lakh crore of bonds purchased by the central bank over the previous OMO auctions.\nThe response to the previous auctions was reasonably good as banks willingly offloaded bonds from their HTM (hold-to-maturity) books to book profits.\nAnalysts at Nomura said the announcement of Rs 1 lakh crore of OMO auctions, to be held on March 12 and 18, together with the dollar/rupee buy-sell swap auction of $10 billion on March 24, has come as a positive surprise. “The total injection of Rs 1.87 lakh crore is above market expectations,” they wrote. “OMO purchases will elevate the supply pressure coming from SDLs and push bond yields lower, “they added.\nThe infusion is significant considering there is no supply of central government bonds in March.\nExperts said the yield on the 10-year benchmark is expected to hover between 6.65% and 6.70% as the RBI has promised to provide liquidity as and when required.

It would conduct a dollar/rupee buy/sell swap auction on March 24 of $10 billion - thereby injecting an equivalent of about ₹86,950 crore at Wednesday's exchange rate.\nFrance's borrowing costs exceeded those of traditional European debt laggard Italy on Tuesday, reflecting investor worries over the country's finances and political stability after Prime Minister Francois Bayrou's ouster.\nThe daily average liquidity deficit in February was ₹1.66 lakh crore, and in March, it was about ₹94,000 crore. Both measures announced by the RBI will inject durable liquidity into the system. In the past, the RBI conducted dollar/rupee buy/sell swaps of $5 billion for three months and $10 billion for three years.\nThe dollar/rupee swap allows the RBI to purchase dollars from banks in exchange for rupees, which are then released into the system. It is expected to improve liquidity, which has been in deficit in recent months due to the forex interventions by the RBI.\n\"Liquidity tends to decline after mid-March due to advance tax outflows. In addition, there are uncertainties on the quantum of drag on liquidity due to foreign exchange interventions as global headwinds persist,\" said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank. \"The RBI is aligning liquidity conditions with the 25-basis-point rate cut announced last month to ensure that transmission takes place.\"\nLiquidity, Growth, Rates\nAdequate liquidity in the banking system makes it easier for banks to transmit a policy rate cut and supports economic growth.\nAccording to Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, the measures taken by the RBI will be adequate to address the liquidity deficit until the end of this month. \"There are banks that are having surpluses and these are being parked in the standing deposit facility . The RBI also has the option to infuse some liquidity via the overnight variable repo rate auctions,\" he said.\nTreasury heads and bank economists expected the RBI to announce further liquidity infusion measures, particularly after Governor Sanjay Malhotra said soon after its board meeting in New Delhi last month that the central bank would provide adequate liquidity support.\n\"In addition to advance tax outflows due mid-March, state development loan auctions will also lead to temporary liquidity outflow. Of course, the money will come back, but with a lag,\" said Rajeev Pawar, head of treasury at Ujjivan Small Finance Bank.\nWeekly auctions of state development loans are higher in the March quarter as states usually backload their borrowings, unlike the Centre, which frontloads it. The indicative market borrowing calendar shows states and union territories issued weekly auctions in the range of ₹25,000 crore to ₹54,000 crore in the March quarter compared to ₹13,000 crore-₹33,000 crore in the December quarter However, at times, there is a deviation in the amount that is borrowed depending on the demand for cash from the states.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

Students have been quietly facilitating international money transfers for years, a practice that is now gaining attention.\nThe central bank's 2003 regulation granted 'non-resident Indian' (NRI) status to overseas students. This measure was primarily implemented to support students who sought employment abroad to fund their education. Previously, these students were classified as 'residents'. The change aimed to protect working students from inadvertently violating the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 2000, which required residents to repatriate their foreign earnings.\nAccording to an ET report, affluent Indian families realised that their children's NRI status could serve as an avenue for substantial international fund transfers, an option not available to 'resident' parents under existing regulations.\nCourse correction\n\"Once a person is treated as a non-resident under FEMA, he is entitled to freely repatriate all current income in India and all capital sums up to $1 million every financial year from his NRO bank account... compared to a resident who can remit only $250,000. If RBI is considering reviewing this circular, it may be worthwhile for the regulator to draw a distinction for those students who go for long-duration courses, say, more than 4 years. Such persons could continue to be classified as non-residents under FEMA,\" Anup P. Shah, partner of the CA firm Pravin P. Shah & Company, was quoted as saying.\nVarious tax and FEMA experts who spoke with the financial daily indicated that RBI might review the circular to establish clear guidelines between legitimate students with overseas part-time employment and those seeking NRI status solely for fund transfers abroad.\nAlso Read |\nTurnaround from importer to exporter! India now shipping Apple product components to China & VietnamMoin Ladha, partner at Khaitan & Co, explains, \"The primary criteria for determining residency is an individual's intention to leave India for an uncertain period.\" He notes the distinction between long-term university students and those attending brief courses. \"The regulators or the government may be seeking to clarify this distinction to prevent the misuse of enhanced financial limits available to NRIs by students enrolling in short-term programs without the intention or ability to secure employment or remain abroad.\"\nSome observers suggest that substantial fund transfers might have been integral to the strategy of affluent families choosing overseas relocation and foreign citizenship. Current regulations permit previously transferred or received funds to remain abroad, even if the student later returns to establish residency in India.\nAlso Read |\nTaxpayers take note!

Shah, partner at Jayantilal Thakkar & Company, a firm specialising in tax and FEMA matters, states, \"The 2003 circular on students becoming NRIs was issued a year RBI allowed LRS. Now after 22 years, it is crystal clear that RBI considers such students as NRIs. However, students should keep in mind the intention of RBI behind the circular rather than using it for the ultimate benefit of their families. RBI may intervene to restrict use of such circular if they deem fit.\"", "text_len": 3463}

This was after the completion of borrowing by the government for the current financial year.\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) data, the cut-off yield on 10-year benchmark bond was set in the range of 6.7270-7.1889 percent in FY25, the lowest since FY22, when the range was 5.9937-6.78 percent.\nAccording to the Venkatakrishnan Srinivasan, founder and managing partner of Rockfort Fincap LLP, this fiscal has witnessed an unusually tight range in 10-year benchmark bond cut-off yields, driven by sustained foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows following India’s inclusion in global bond indices, expectations of monetary easing, fiscal consolidation, a well-balanced supply-demand dynamic and strong institutional participation.\n“These factors have led to a sharp compression in yields, with the 10-year bond yield dropping over 100 basis points despite the absence of a rate cut,” Srinivasan added.\nIn FY22, the repo rate was lower at 4.00 percent and the RBI, after keeping its policy rate lower during the pandemic, was increasing it amid high inflation, hence yields were going up at a moderate rate.\nThe subsequent two financial years saw a higher yield on government securities due to higher inflation and higher repo rate for a longer period.\nIn FY25, demand for the benchmark government securities from foreign investors has risen sharply due to the inclusion of Indian bonds in two global bond indices—JP Morgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets and Bloomberg Emerging Market (EM) Local Currency Index—leading to an inflow of Rs 1.04 lakh crore since then.\nUmesh Kumar Tulsyan, managing director of Sovereign Global Markets, a Delhi-based fund house, said in FY25, the RBI initially paused the rate-hike cycle it had been on since early 2023, reinforcing stability in bond markets. Inflation has moderated significantly, with the RBI maintaining its FY25 projection at 4.8 percent, down from 6.7 percent in FY23, aided by proactive supply-side measures.\nFurther, Tulsyan said that the government’s fiscal consolidation efforts—with a revised fiscal deficit target of 4.8 percent of GDP for FY25 and an intention of bringing it down to 4.4 percent by FY26—further supported market sentiment and helped bond yields remain stable in FY25\nExperts added that anticipation of the rate cut by the RBI in February after last year's monetary policy decisions, including the one in December 2024 may have bolstered support to discount rates on the bond. Discounting rates means adjusting yields on the bond by buying or selling in the market.\nThe central bank in the February monetary policy delivered a rate cut of 25 basis points due to declining inflation and in anticipation of a recovery in growth in coming quarters.\nGoing ahead, yields on government securities are expected to remain lower due to expectations of a further rate cut to support growth.\n“While this trend is likely to persist in the near term, potential risks such as global yield volatility, increased domestic bond supply, rupee depreciation and liquidity tightening could introduce intermittent fluctuations. Nevertheless, with a strong structural bid for Indian bonds and a favourable macroeconomic backdrop, the yield environment is expected to remain stable,” Srinivasan added.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Advocate Dhond, however, clarified that the RBI will not go into the merits of the case after a complaint is filed, but only see if mandatory procedures were followed before passing the order. The court accepted his statement, and asked Anil Ambani to lodge a complaint with the RBI.\nThe practise by the banks to declare a loan acocunt as fraudulent has been under scrutiny for long. The courts as well as the RBI have issued directions for banks to observe the correct process for this practice.\nThe RBI's 2016 fraud circular\nThe RBI's master circular on fraud issued in 2016, titled 'Master Directions on Frauds – Classification and Reporting by Commercial Banks and Select FIs', which allowed banks to tag loans as fraud, had been misused grossly, many had thought at that time. Banks' random use of fraud classification of loan accounts resulted in many cases of loan defaults being declared as frauds. These classification and reporting procedures were challenged in courts.\nA loan account was categorised as a 'fraud account' after it was red-flagged on the basis of practices like fund diversion (even if there is no siphoning off of money from the company). A bank was supposed to report the fraud to RBI within 21 days of its detection as well as report it to the CBI or the economic offences wing of the police depending on the amount involved.\nWhy the RBI issued the circular\nThe RBI's 2016 circular came in the background of many big cases of bank fraud hitting the headlines even as banks struggled with high non-performing assets. Early detection of loan fraud and its timely reporting by banks were considered important for containing frauds. All banks, across the board, had a problem with unscrupulous borrowers milking lapses and loopholes in the system, and defrauding them.\nBut banks took years to even recognise that they were victims of an elaborate web of deception. Their reluctance stemmed from reputational risks, interference of probe agencies, and the instinct of self-preservation. Sometimes, even failure by the third-party ecosystem, such as credit rating agencies or auditors to highlight risks was also to blame. The 2016 RBI circular stipulated timelines with the action incumbent on a bank. The timelines/stage-wise actions in the loan life-cycle were aimed at compressing the total time taken by a bank to identify a fraud and aid more effective action by the law enforcement agencies. The circular said the early detection of fraud and the necessary corrective action were important to reduce the quantum of loss which the continuance of the fraud may entail.\nHowever, the RBI guidelines also drew criticism as many thought that the definition, inclusion and imposition of fraud were constitutionally vague and ambiguous, which led to arbitrary and discriminatory proceedings. Hence, it was open to interpretation by different investigative agencies, suited to its needs and wants. The RBI circular also did not provide any provision for issuance of show-cause notice or affording a hearing to the affected party before the classification as fraud.\nLater, the Supreme Court ruled that the RBI's master circular on fraud was in defiance of principles of natural justice or 'audi alteram partem' which means the other side must be heard.\nThe RBI's revised master directive in 2024\nIn July 2024, the RBI asked banks to give borrowers at least three weeks to respond before tagging them as fraud accounts. The regulator also said the decision conveyed to the borrower must contain their submission and reasons for classifying the account as fraud. The RBI issued a revised master directive on fraud risk management following a Supreme Court judgement which said that banks should adhere to the principles of natural justice and cannot unilaterally declare an account as fraud without providing defaulters with the right to be heard.\nThe central bank stated that the revised guidelines would also apply to regional rural banks, rural cooperative banks and housing finance companies. Banks would need to issue a show-cause notice (SCN) with complete details of the fraudulent transactions. They must have a well-planned system for issuing SCNs and examining responses by persons or entities before declaring an account as fraud. The RBI also stated that lenders must give the person or entities on whom the SCN is issued a \"reasonable time\" of not less than 21 days to respond. The regulator also said that lenders should issue a \"reasoned order\", which should contain the relevant facts and circumstances relied upon, the submission made against the SCN, and the reasons for classification as fraud or otherwise.\nA board-approved policy on fraud risk management should be reviewed once every three years. The board of each bank must constitute a special committee to monitor fraudulent cases. The committee should be headed by an independent or non-executive director and have at least three members, comprising a whole-time director and a minimum of two independent directors.\nThe revised guidelines also contained a framework on Early Warning Signals (EWS) and Red-Flagging of Accounts (RFA). They include details on ways to strengthen further early detection and prevention of fraud by regulated entities and timely reporting to law enforcement agencies and supervisors.\nWhen RBI told banks to speed up\nIn December last year, the RBI turned down banks' plea for more time to brand a dodgy borrower as \"wilful defaulter\" - a client who diverts borrowed funds or refuses to repay loans despite having the wherewithal to do so.

The government has revised its full year growth estimate for FY25 at 6.5% from 6.4% earlier.\nSecular Improvement\nBusiness conditions improved across all three monitored sub-sectors: consumer, intermediate and investment goods. While firms recorded a rise in new export orders, the demand was softer than January. Moreover, job expansion also tapered from the previous month, showed the survey.Producers also faced rising input cost pressures, and were able to pass on the costs to consumers, on account of a stronger demand.\nIndian manufacturers faced another rise in input costs, with frequent reports of greater bamboo, leather, marketing, rubber and telecom prices. Encouragingly, the overall rate of inflation eased for the third straight month to its weakest in a year.\nThe fall in manufacturing activity did little to affect optimism, as outlook remained positive with firms banking on demand to lift growth in the coming year.\n\"Business expectations also remained very strong, with nearly one-third of survey participants foreseeing greater output volumes in the year ahead. Although output growth slowed to the weakest level since December 2023, overall momentum in India's manufacturing sector remained broadly positive in February,\" Bhandari said.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 2072}

The gap raises concerns about growth momentum holding up in the coming quarters, particularly as fiscal support is set to taper off.\nHigher actual GDP growth translates to more economic activity, more jobs and more consumption and vice versa. India, with millions entering the job market every year, is not creating enough jobs to accommodate all of them. This needs to change or we will walk into a job crisis.\nIncremental policy measures — such as the 25 basis point repo rate cut in February and another expected in April — appear insufficient.\nMore robust monetary easing is needed to lower borrowing costs further, stimulate private investment and boost consumer spending. These actions will help bridge the gap between current performance and the higher growth required for a stable recovery.\nMounting global trade tensions and tightening of financial conditions add to the challenge, making it imperative for the RBI to adopt an \"accommodative\" stance to provide the additional support needed to sustain economic activity.\nMPC Minutes show pro-growth tilt\nA pro-growth tilt is evident in the minutes of the February meeting of the monetary policy committee led by Sanjay Malhotra, his first policy review after taking over as the RBI governor.\nThe minutes signal a decisive shift in focus — from an unwavering battle against inflation to a more balanced approach that accommodates growth. Malhotra made a compelling case for monetary easing, with his vote for a 25-basis point rate cut, the first in almost five years, marking a pivotal moment in India’s monetary policy stance. His reasoning is difficult to dispute.\nMalhotra’s confidence in the disinflationary trajectory is well-founded. After breaching the RBI’s upper tolerance band of 6 percent in October, headline inflation has moderated, with food prices showing clear signs of easing. A robust kharif harvest, seasonal correction in vegetable prices and a promising rabi crop outlook further bolster the view. Fiscal consolidation and budgetary measures aimed at supporting agriculture reinforce expectations of continued price stability.\nWith consumer price index (CPI) inflation projected at 4.2 percent for 2025-26 — comfortably within the RBI’s target range — the justification for a restrictive policy stance weakens considerably.\nIf inflation is expected to align with the target, maintaining an unnecessarily high rate risks stifling growth at a crucial juncture.\nMalhotra rightly pointed out that a lower policy rate would bolster household consumption, housing investments and capital expenditure — key drivers of aggregate demand. Given that inflation is trending downward while growth requires support, monetary easing is not just advisable but essential.\nNot only Malhotra, but his MPC colleagues, too, acknowledge the growth concerns. Deputy governor Rajeshwar Rao said, “The current environment is replete with uncertainties”, as he called for a flexible approach to the monetary policy. This aligns with Malhotra’s stance —while caution is warranted due to global financial volatility, trade disruptions and climate-related risks, excessive conservatism could prove counterproductive.\nRajiv Ranjan, another MPC member, said with the Budget sustaining public investment and offering tax concessions to boost disposable incomes, monetary policy must now do its part.\nAnother panel member, Saugata Bhattacharya, echoed the sentiment. “I am now cautiously optimistic about the downward trajectory of inflation… The required policy response on the inflation-growth trade-off seems skewed in favour of the latter,” Bhattacharya said.\nNagesh Kumar reinforced the case for a rate cut, arguing that it would stimulate demand for housing and durable goods while lowering the cost of capital for private investment.\nThe message from the MPC is unambiguous: monetary policy must pivot towards growth. Now, it must walk the talk.\n(Banking Central is a weekly column that keeps a close watch on and connects the dots regarding the sector's most important events for readers.)\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

But the crucial manufacturing sector is losing impetus, shows the latest Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data—a private survey.\nThe seasonally adjusted HSBC India Manufacturing PMI slipped to a 14-month low of 56.3 in February from 57.7 in January. The fall was driven by softer new orders and production growth. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.\nWhile the headline PMI stays in the expansion zone, it is hardly a comfort as cost pressures still linger. Indian manufacturers faced another rise in input costs, with frequent reports of greater bamboo, leather, marketing, rubber and telecom prices, said the PMI survey report.\nAlso Read: A sombre December manufacturing PMI curbs enthusiasm\nSubdued demand\nLately, manufacturers have been raising selling prices to protect margins. In February, too, firms passed on higher labour costs to clients. A concern here is that elevated product prices could hamper demand. The survey showed that Indian manufacturers have expressed strong optimism about growth prospects for the coming year, with client demand expected to remain positive and support output. Even so, the PMI’s gauge for business confidence—the Future Output Index has eased to 64.9 from 65.1 in the previous month.\nBut this optimism faces many hurdles. External headwinds from global trade policy uncertainty and commodity price volatility tend to have repercussions on corporates and India’s macroeconomic position.\nThe NSO data released on Friday showed that India’s GDP grew 6.2% in Q3FY25, a tad above expectations. However, manufacturing growth was sluggish, weighed down by weak corporate profitability, with the services sector showing resilience. FY25 GDP growth rate was revised higher to 6.5% from 6.4% earlier.\nAlso Read: GDP growth: India’s latest economic data stirs up a range of emotions\n“This (revised FY25 GDP growth rate) implies steep growth of 7.6% year-on-year in Q4FY25. We see downside risk with Q4FY25 GDP growth is expected to be closer to 6.8%,\" said IDFC First Bank's 28 February report.\nHigh-frequency indicators in Q4FY24 are mixed, with the rise in rural consumption and central government capital expenditure, but urban demand remains relatively subdued, with a slowdown in electronic payments (UPI, credit and debit card usage) and a further slowdown in passenger vehicle growth, the IDFC report added.\nRBI push\nThe likely positive impact on urban consumption buoyed by the recent cut in income taxes, pick-up in government capex, monetary, and regulatory easing by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which began in February, is expected to come, albeit with some lag. On the monetary policy front, wide-held expectations are that the RBI would opt for a 25-basis points repo rate cut in April as well, aided by moderating inflation pressures, which provides scope to spur growth.\nBut it is a tedious task. A subdued household savings rate due to muted income growth in the post-covid era points to demand pain. Plus, the wealth effects from strong equity markets have also started to reverse, given the sharp correction in benchmark indices over the past three to four months, said Radhika Rao, executive director and senior economist at DBS Bank.\nAlso Read: We can’t expect budget tax cuts to boost GDP growth all that much\nStriking a similar note of caution, Nomura Global Markets Research said this cyclical growth slowdown still has legs. The proprietary Nomura India Composite Leading Index, which has a one-quarter lead on non-agricultural GDP growth, has been sequentially moderating since Q1 2024 and has been below the 100 threshold for three quarters now, which points to below-trend growth and an ongoing cyclical growth slowdown. The broking firm estimates FY25 GDP growth rate at 6.2%.", "text_len": 4121}

They are now focusing on increasing the share of retail deposits with the aim to reduce their cost of funding amid tight liquidity conditions.\n“We will be mindful of how to contain bulk deposits…we are not going to go for bulk deposits or the certificate of deposits,” Ashok Chandra, MD & CEO, Punjab National Bank, said after announcing the bank’s third-quarter earnings. “We want to cut down on bulk deposits because it will also help (us) protect NIMs,” he said.\nBulk deposits carry higher interest rates, increasing the bank’s cost of funds. In an environment where interest rates are expected to decline, banks may struggle to earn higher returns on loans, creating pressure on NIM, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and interest paid on deposits. For banks, the benefit of lower cost comes with a lag as assets get re-priced quicker than liabilities. Reducing high-cost bulk deposits allows banks to maintain a healthier spread between what they earn and what they pay.\n“In this quarter (October-December) our wholesale deposits and deposits from financial entities came down by Rs 4,000-5,000 crore and in spite of that we have managed 11% growth in deposits year-on-year,” said Harsh Dugar, executive director, Federal Bank. “There are two reasons behind this decision — one is cost and the second is liquidity,” he said.\nBulk deposits tend to be less stable and more volatile. They can be withdrawn quickly, posing liquidity challenges during periods of market stress or economic uncertainty. On the contrary, retail depositors are less likely to move funds frequently, providing a stable funding base. This predictability helps banks plan lending and investment without worrying about sudden withdrawals.\nThe credit-to-deposit ratio remained elevated at around 80% at the end of January. While credit growth has moderated, term deposits are rising faster, driving up the cost of funds.\nFixed deposits of banks have increased by nearly 10% to Rs 134.2 lakh crore as on December 2024 from Rs 122.6 lakh crore as on December 2023, according to RBI data. Total deposits have grown by 5.6% to Rs 217.7 lakh crore as of December 2024 from Rs 206 lakh crore as of March 2024.\nWith the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expected to cut the repo rate by 50- 75 basis points in the next financial year, experts say that declining rate trajectory could further strain NIMs of banks.\n“Lending rates may continue to face downward pressure, potentially leading to a slight decline in NIMs for banks in the upcoming quarters,” said Sanjay Agarwal, senior director, Care Ratings. “However, the rising cost of funds, driven by ongoing re-pricing and select banks increasing tenures to attract deposits and sustain credit growth, is exerting additional pressure on NIMs,” he added.", "text_len": 2913}

Since yesterday, the Sensex and Nifty are up nearly 2 percent.\nKey drivers of the market rally:\n1) China stimulus hopes: Market participants are anticipating further stimulus measures from Chinese authorities to boost consumption and offset economic pressures amid escalating trade war with the United States. This has led to a surge in base metal prices, supporting a rally in metal stocks in India. Nifty Metal index rose nearly 2 percent in trade. “Base metals rallied in Asian trade on the prospect of further China stimulus measures,” Daniel Hynes, senior commodity strategist at ANZ Bank told Reuters.\n2) Positive global cues: Asian markets followed an overnight rally on Wall Street after US President Donald Trump softened his stance on new tariffs for Mexico and Canada. South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.7 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng surged over 3 percent. The S&P 500 jumped 1.1 percent to 5,842.63, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.3 percent to 43,006.59, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.46 percent to 18,552.73. China also posted better than expected manufacturing PMI data which provided a boost to investor sentiment.\n3) Weakening dollar index: The US dollar index slipped to a four-month low of 104.3, which is considered favourable for emerging markets like India. “If this trend continues, foreign institutional investor (FII) selling may subside, paving the way for further market gains,” said V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.\n4) Crude oil decline: Crude oil prices plunged to a six-month low, lifting market sentiment. Shares of oil marketing companies (OMCs) extended their gains for the fourth consecutive session. Brent crude hovered below USD 70 per barrel after the OPEC+ alliance decided to increase output from April, a move expected to benefit Indian refiners by improving marketing margins on retail fuel. “The escalation of the trade war has raised concerns about global demand, adding pressure on oil prices,” said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities at Mehta Equities Ltd.\n5) RBI liquidity measures: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) continued efforts to inject liquidity into the banking system. It announced open market purchases of government securities and USD/INR swaps amounting to Rs 1.9 lakh crore. On February 28, the central bank conducted a $10 billion swap to boost long-term liquidity, which saw strong demand.\nShares of financial services companies such as Shriram Finance, Bajaj Finance, and Bajaj Finserv were up nearly 3 percent. Indices related to the financial space such as Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial Services, Nifty Private Bank, and Nifty PSU Bank rose up to 1 percent.\nTechnical outlook:\nAnand James, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, noted that the Nifty’s close above 22,400 has confirmed a morning star candlestick pattern, indicating a trend reversal. “The next resistance is seen at 22,513, but we expect enough momentum to push towards 23,000. However, volatility must remain contained above 22,270 for the uptrend to sustain. A break below 22,190 could challenge the upside view,” he added.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

In January 2025, the banking system's cash deficit reached Rs 3.34 lakh crore ($40.5 billion), the highest in 14 years. This isn’t just a banking problem—it’s a systemic issue affecting the broader economy. While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has implemented measures like a $10 billion dollar-rupee swap in February 2025 and ongoing open market operations (OMOs), the liquidity gap persists. If rate cuts alone can’t solve this, what will?\nThe Liquidity Squeeze: A Systemic Challenge\nLiquidity refers to the availability of cash and short-term funds to meet immediate payment obligations. When it tightens, financial institutions (FIs)—banks, NBFCs, MFIs, and fintechs—find it harder to lend. This slowdown ripples through the economy, stifling growth. For instance, small businesses, farmers, and MSMEs, which rely heavily on credit, face delays or denials in accessing loans.\nTo address the growing liquidity crunch, the RBI announced a $10 billion dollar-rupee swap in February 2025. This mechanism allows banks to exchange dollars for rupees, providing them with immediate liquidity while committing to reverse the transaction at a later date. Additionally, the RBI has purchased government bonds worth thousands of crores through OMOs to inject cash into the system. Despite these efforts, structural challenges such as weak deposit growth, elevated government borrowings, and tightening global liquidity conditions continue to strain the financial system.\nFor NBFCs and MFIs, which extend credit to underserved segments, the situation is dire. Forced to borrow at higher rates, they pass on these costs to end customers, making credit more expensive. This not only limits access to affordable loans but also slows down economic activity in critical sectors like agriculture, MSMEs, and low-income households.\nDeposit Growth: A Structural Hurdle\nWhile liquidity is an immediate concern, weak deposit growth is a deeper structural issue. Over the past year, credit growth has outpaced deposit growth by a significant margin—16% versus 11%. This imbalance forces FIs to offer higher interest rates on deposits, increasing their cost of funds and compressing net interest margins (NIMs).\nHousehold savings have shifted from bank deposits to mutual funds, equities, and other high-yielding instruments. With inflation eroding real returns, savers are opting for alternatives, leaving FIs with a shrinking pool of low-cost funds.\nBeyond Rate Cuts: Smarter Strategies for Growth\nIn this challenging environment, FIs need to look beyond traditional fixes and adopt innovative strategies to sustain credit growth. Here’s how:\n1. AI-Driven Underwriting and Alternative Data\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are transforming how FIs assess credit risk. By leveraging alternative data—such as utility payments, GST filings, and digital transaction histories—FIs can build more accurate credit profiles, especially for borrowers with limited formal credit histories.\nIndia’s digital infrastructure is a goldmine. The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has created a rich trail of transaction data, while the Account Aggregator framework enables seamless sharing of financial data across institutions (with customer consent).\n2. Agile Credit Business Rules Engines (BREs)\nEconomic conditions are constantly shifting, and rigid lending strategies won’t cut it anymore. Enter Credit Business Rules Engines (BREs)—digital toolkits that allow lenders to test and tweak credit policies in real-time. Think of BREs as a GPS system that recalculates routes instantly based on traffic conditions.\nWhether it’s exploring new borrower segments, adjusting loan pricing, or responding to RBI’s regulatory changes, BREs enable FIs to adapt quickly without waiting for lengthy IT updates. Many leading lenders in India have already integrated BREs into their operations, using them to automate loan approvals, refine risk-based pricing, and speed up processing times.\n3. Risk-Based Pricing\nNot all borrowers are the same, so why should their interest rates be? Risk-based pricing tailors rates to individual risk profiles, charging higher rates to riskier borrowers and offering lower rates to those with strong credit histories. This approach balances risk and reward, boosting profitability while incentivising borrowers to improve their creditworthiness over time.\nThe Road Ahead\nThe lending slowdown in India isn’t just about high interest rates—it’s a complex puzzle with multiple pieces. Weak deposit growth, liquidity constraints, and structural challenges are all part of the picture. While the RBI’s efforts to balance growth and inflation are commendable, FIs need to step up their game.\nBy embracing AI-driven underwriting, leveraging alternative data through UPI and the Account Aggregator framework, and adopting risk-based pricing, FIs can navigate these challenges and keep credit flowing. The question isn’t just about rate cuts—it’s about smarter, faster, and more inclusive lending. And that’s where the real opportunity lies.\n(Joydip Gupta, Head of APAC at Scienaptic AI.)\nViews are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

He said creating a supportive environment without any confusion will contribute to the overall development of banking transactions.\nPresiding over the district lead bank progress review meeting held at the Dr VS Acharya Auditorium, Rajathadri on Tuesday, he said bank officials should work towards increasing the credit-deposit (CD) ratio by ensuring that 60% of the total deposits are distributed as loans, as per the guidelines of the Reserve Bank of India. Some banks have a low CD ratio, which needs improvement in the coming days, he said.\nTo help entrepreneurs in the district establish livelihood activities and generate more employment opportunities, loans amounting to Rs 40 crore were distributed to 131 beneficiaries under the Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP). He directed that all approved applications under the PMEGP scheme should be processed on priority, and eligible beneficiaries should receive subsidies without delay.\nRegarding sector-wise achievements in the district, the agriculture sector achieved 67.2% of its target, the MSME sector 72.8%, the education sector 81.1%, housing sector achieved 53.3%, and other sectors completed 66.6% of the target.\nExpressing concern over the low number of approved applications under the PM Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Bayal directed officials to raise awareness among the public and encourage more beneficiaries to apply. He said once applications are accepted, they should not be rejected unnecessarily. Any obstacles in loan distribution should be addressed, and achieving the set targets should be a priority. He also called for the swift processing of pending applications under the PM Vishwakarma Yojana.\nCanara Bank's regional manager Sheeba Sahajan noted that the deposit ratio in the banking sector increased slightly from 48.41% last year to 48.47% this year, a marginal rise of 0.06%. However, the fact that the district's CD ratio remains below 50% is a matter of concern, and all banks should take active measures to improve it in the coming days.\nThe meeting was attended by district lead bank manager Harish G, RBI executive Ela Sahu, NABARD DDM Sangeeta Kartha, SCDCC bank assistant general manager Rajesh Shetty, various district-level officials, bank heads, and others.", "text_len": 2450}

Paused due to rising prices, it ran until 2024.\nSovereign Gold Bonds Explained: The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, introduced the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) Scheme in 2016 as an alternative investment to physical gold. This scheme offered investors tax-free capital gains with a 2.5 per cent annual interest. Investors would pay the initial amount in cash and receive the maturity amount in cash as well. It is managed by RBI.\nHowever, due to rising gold prices, the Indian government has paused the SGB scheme and no new tranches have been announced.

The redemption price is calculated based on the simple average of the closing price of 999 purity gold for the previous 3 business days, as published by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Limited.\nRedemption Payment: Both the earned interest and the redemption amount are directly credited to the investor’s bank account linked to the bond.\nRedemption Procedure: Investors receive a notification one month before the maturity date. On the maturity date, the proceeds are automatically credited to the registered bank account. Any changes in account details, such as bank account number or email address, must be communicated to the concerned bank/SHCIL/PO promptly.\nSGB Early Redemption Process – How To Apply\nWhile the bond tenure is 8 years, investors can choose to redeem their bonds prematurely after 5 years from the issue date on any coupon payment date.\nInvestors seeking premature redemption must approach their respective bank/SHCIL office/Post Office/agent 30 days prior to the coupon payment date. The request will be processed only if submitted at least one day before the coupon payment date.\nShould You Wait For Maturity Or Exit Prematurely?\nAccording to a CNBC TV18 report, Trivesh D, COO of Tradejini, suggests that investors might consider exiting SGBs if they require immediate funds or if better investment opportunities arise. However, he highlights that holding SGBs until maturity can be advantageous due to the 2.5 per cent annual interest and tax-free capital gains.\nSGB Alternative Investment Option\nTrivesh stated that several alternatives exist for investors given the current pause on SGBs. He suggests Gold ETFs as a suitable option, combining ease of use with high liquidity. Other options include gold mutual funds and digital gold.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips by experts in this News18.com report are their own and not those of the website or its management.

We are hopeful that there will be some resolution in case all banks find it difficult to switch over to the new mechanism,” another executive said on condition of anonymity.\nA spokesperson for SWIFT, in an emailed response to ET’s queries, referred to the ISO 20022 guidelines and frequently asked questions (FAQs) which state that it is crucial that all financial institutions maintain their key objective to migrate to ISO 20022 and complete their implementation without delay. The deadline was reconfirmed by the SWIFT Board for cross-border FI-to-FI (financial institution, either supervised or unsupervised) payment instructions at its June 2024 meeting.\n“MT (message type) payment instructions will not be supported by the FIN service for FI-toFI cross-border flows after that date. SWIFT is building selective and chargeable short-term contingency measures to ensure business continuity for the community and a smooth exit from the coexistence period,” according to the SWIFT guidelines.\nMT is a traditional message type for use on the SWIFT network.\nAs per SWIFT, ISO 20022 will impact all financial institutions active in cross-border payments as well as market infrastructures and corporates, though only the cross-border payments and reporting messages are subject to the CBPR+ (Cross Border Payments and Reporting Plus) migration timelines.\nA bankers’ panel is already examining the possibilities to scale up the Reserve Bank of India’s existing platform—Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS).\nBuilt on the lines of SWIFT, the SFMS can be used for all purposes of secure communication within the bank and between banks. In its 2022 Vision Document, the RBI made a case for expanding the ambit of SFMS.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 2804}

In contrast, CASA deposits had risen from Rs 78.27 lakh crore at the end of March 2023 to Rs 78.69 lakh crore by December 2023.\nMeanwhile, fixed deposits grew nearly 10% in the first nine months of the current fiscal as banks increased interest rates to attract customers amid a liquidity crunch.\n“A behavioural shift is witnessed because of higher interest rates that term deposits offer,” said Vinay Tonse, managing director, SBI. “And it is observed that whenever there is a gap between the savings bank interest rate and term deposits because of the higher interest-rate scenario, naturally there is a shift, there is a temptation for the balance holders to shift to term deposits. That is exactly what we are seeing.”\nWhile banks are struggling to mobilise CASA deposits, they have registered a healthy growth in fixed deposits as customers chase higher rates. Fixed deposits have increased to Rs 134.2 lakh crore as of December 2024, from Rs 122.6 lakh crore as of December 2023. Last year, fixed deposit grew by 14% to reach Rs 117.6 lakh crore as of December 2023.\nOver the past one year, banks have seen the CASA ratio declining as depositors moved their funds to high-yield fixed deposits. With liquidity being tight, banks have hiked fixed deposits rates to mobilise funds to drive the credit growth. In the third quarter results, most of the banks witnessed year-on-year declines in CASA deposits.\nBanks prefer to keep a high level of CASA as these are sticky and a cheap source of funds for them.\nExperts expect improvement in deposit mobilisation in the next financial year. “Banks are expected to see an improvement in CASA mobilisation starting next financial year as we enter a rate-cut cycle. The interest rate gap between CASA and fixed deposits will narrow as banks are likely to lower rates,” said the head of liabilities of a private bank.\nThe RBI cut the repo rate by 25 basis points in February. The central bank is seen reducing rates further by 50-75 bps in the next financial year. This will lead to a reduction in interest rates offered on fixed deposits by banks.", "text_len": 2537}

Over the past few weeks, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra, and Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran have all indicated that the government and regulatory machinery are keen to remove bottlenecks in compliance and regulatory decision-making, making it a significant reform plank for India in 2025.\nPerhaps the most welcome news has been the announcement by the PM to set up a Deregulation Commission aimed at minimising bureaucratic hurdles and alleviating the compliance burden across sectors, once again bringing the “ease of doing business” in India back in focus.\nOne of the most impactful areas for deregulation could be fintech, particularly financial regulators. India’s financial market necessitates careful oversight, balancing growth, and stability through judicious regulation. There is immense respect for India’s financial regulators as their efforts to strike this balance have allowed our economic system to be robust, stable, safe, and healthy.\nNothing can diminish that overarching goal. At the same time, the balance between promoting innovation and ensuring regulation is critical. Malhotra has emphasised the need to refine the regulatory framework to foster innovation while safeguarding consumers.\nStrategic deregulation in the financial sector can catalyse growth, innovation, and competitiveness, fostering a business-friendly environment and attracting investments. This involves carefully assessing each regulation to ensure it strikes the right balance: promoting innovation and protecting consumers without stifling growth. Independent evaluations are invaluable to ensure objectivity.\nAs emphasised by the Economic Survey, a proactive approach necessitates a robust regulatory impact assessment (RIA) mechanism to ensure quality and prevent unintended consequences. Since regulations are the primary tools that our regulators use to shape the market, RIA is essential to maximise their effectiveness. This approach integrates existing surveillance tools with a comprehensive view of regulatory impact.\nMalhotra has reassured stakeholders of continued consultation and pledged smooth implementation of new regulations. To ensure continuous open dialogues, these stakeholder consultations need immense commitment and consistency from the industry and the regulator. Establishing a regular 360-degree feedback loop with external expertise to monitor and assess regulatory effectiveness is essential to ensure this.\nAt the ministry level, the endeavour is to reduce the compliance burden and enable a path of deregulation. As the sector evolves, so does the quality of regulations, encompassing accountability, accessibility, open procedures, expertise, and efficiency. Effective regulation also requires enforcement; in 2023-24, the RBI imposed penalties of `86.1 crore, and the Securities and Exchanges Board of India levied `74.66 crore in fines. Beyond enforcement, a proactive assessment of the impact of their decisions is a valuable practice for regulators.\nThis impact assessment is critical because over-regulation can significantly stifle innovation, particularly for start-ups where time is of the essence. Product-market fit typically requires 18-24 months, encompassing developing a minimum viable product and subsequent iterations. Prescriptive regulations can upend this time frame, forcing start-ups to pivot or abandon promising ventures. Performance-based standards that outline functional requirements while allowing flexibility offers a more practical approach. Regulators are also in the business of disruption, albeit a different kind: balancing disruptive innovation and systematic stability. Even the RBI endorsed that regulation, like everything else, has costs, recognising the trade-offs between stability and efficiency.\nIndependent assessments provide the foundation for a regulatory framework that safeguards stability and actively cultivates innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.\nA comprehensive evaluation\nNavigating regulations can be challenging for start-ups who need certainty and predictability for growth and development. While regulatory sandboxes have helped start-ups test products and find product-market fit, evolving regulatory requirements — like lending or discount broking — can force them back to the drawing board and lengthen go-to-market cycles. This underscores the need for a nuanced approach to regulation that balances innovation with safeguards.\nThis need for balance through regular impact analysis is globally recognised. RIAs have been implemented across a range of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member and non-member nations, including the US, UK, Australia, Mexico, Türkiye, New Zealand, and Denmark, with the aim of better policymaking that has socio-economic implications. The OECD recommends that regulators be subject to oversight on problem definition and scope before finalising policy. In the long run, this ensures optimal use of resources, including staffing and administrative costs of deliberating policy decisions.\nAs India moves closer to its $10-trillion economy vision, its innovators and entrepreneurs, supported by a stable regulatory regime, will be crucial to accelerating growth. In a dynamic market, robust enforcement against bad actors is vital, but regulators should be responsive to market dynamics.\nThe proposals to enable impact assessments of regulators and ongoing deregulation efforts signal a commitment to building a favourable investment climate.\nLike those they regulate, regulators strengthen their role through transparency and continuous independent impact assessment, cultivating a flourishing business ecosystem. After all, innovation can’t be mandated, but it can be nurtured.", "text_len": 5917}

The mindset, however, is outdated today, according to Snapdeal Co-founder Kunal Bahl. Setting up business in India is more than just a patriotic move – today it is a pragmatic decision, believes Bahl as he outlines compelling reasons in a post on X for founders to choose India over other countries for registering their startups:\nFunding no longer an issue\nStartups don’t have to incorporate themselves overseas for easier fundraising ability. According to Bahl, Indian investors now back all kinds of startups, including deeptech and AI, unlike probably a decade back when startups had to look abroad for a better fundraising environment.\nFavorable policies\nBahl highlights startup-friendly tax policies, DPIIT (Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade) benefits, and simplified compliance processes by the Indian government that can help founders to start and grow from India. In contrast, incorporating in the US or Singapore can lead to double taxation and regulatory complexities that founders can easily avoid by registering in India.\nSimplified Compliance\nIt makes sense to incorporate in India if a startup’s customers, revenue, and operations are in India. Bahl says being registered in India simplifies compliance, contracts, and access to government incentives. Moreover, as an Indian entity, one can sell to global markets by establishing a subsidiary overseas. “Infosys does it and so can you.”\nEasier exit\nSuccessful startup IPOs such as Zomato, Nykaa, and Unicommerce indicate that the Indian stock market is more than ready for startup. If an Indian startup plans to go public, incorporating locally prevents costly and complicated “flipping” of the company’s structure later, according to Bahl.\nRegulatory hassles abroad\nEstablishing a company in the US or Singapore may look easier initially, but there could be legal complexities, compliance costs, and difficulties in repatriating money to India in the long run. Startups often realize too late that navigating through foreign regulations can be a burden.\nBetter access to domestic capital\nFor Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) to fund companies based in foreign markets require approval from market regulator SEBI. Hence, if your startup is incorporated overseas, you risk losing out on a massive chunk of domestic institutional funding. “You will lock out most of the Indian VC capital by incorporating overseas!”\nAngel investments\nIf your startup is at an early stage and incorporated abroad, angel funding may become a challenge as many Indian angel investors cannot invest significant amount in overseas startups due to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) limits.\nUnder the scheme, all resident individuals, including minors, are allowed to freely remit only up to $2,50,000 per financial year. Hence, if you want funding from Indian angels, incorporating in India is the better choice.\nLess competition for capital\nIf you stay in India and pitch to Indian VCs, it means you are competing with other Indian startups, whereas going to the US means competing globally for capital, making fundraising harder for yourself. “For Indian startups in 2025, the choice is clear: Incorporate in India, Build in India, Win in and from India,” says Bahl.", "text_len": 3429}

Policymakers must address employment and income weaknesses.\nEstimates of gross value added (GVA) and gross domestic product (GDP) for 2024-25 were released last month along with revised estimates for 2023-24 and final data for 2022-23. The numbers for 2024-25 were broadly in line with estimates released earlier, with GDP growth placed at 6.5%, marginally higher than the 6.4% reported as part of India’s first advance estimates.\nHowever, numbers for earlier years were significantly revised upwards, with GDP growth in 2023-24 estimated at 9.2%, as against 8.2% reported in January. Similarly, GDP growth in 2022-23 was upped from 7% to 7.6%.\nThese upward revisions offer hope for a better economic performance than the gloomy picture presented by the January figures. While GDP estimates do get revised based on fresh data, the extent of it this time is unusually large. In any case, stronger growth suggests a sharper economic recovery than what other data sources indicate.\nAlso Read: GDP growth: India’s latest economic data stirs up a range of emotions\nHowever, a closer look at the disaggregated official data and evidence from other sources suggests that any euphoria on this count may be misplaced. First, annual GDP growth rates are not the best way to judge the structural and fundamental strengths of our economy. High growth in 2022-23 and 2023-24 came on a low base in previous years, when output suffered from a slowdown and then the pandemic.\nGDP growth rate in the five years ending 2024-25 has been a modest annual average of 5.3%, the lowest in the previous three decades for any five-year period. It was significantly lower than the 7% achieved during the first term of the current government, despite the slowdown after 2016-17.\nIn some ways, it’s fair to say the economy is yet to recover from the twin shocks of demonetization and GST rollout, with the pandemic only worsening things.\nOn a long-term comparison, most other indicators mirror our GDP growth trend. Growth in private consumption as well as investment remain at least 2 percentage points per annum lower than their pre-2019 rates. Both these issues have been flagged by senior government officials.\nThe latest growth estimates confirm a crisis of slowing demand and investment in the economy. The upward revisions reiterate these concerns. Taking the revised estimates into account, this fiscal year’s slowdown marks the largest decline in growth over the past two decades except for the pandemic years and the global financial crisis of 2008.\nBut a far more serious issue is the discrepancy between India’s broad state-of-the-economy indicators and other data sources. Unlike the national accounts, multiple data sources, both private as well as official, suggest a sustained trend of worsening income growth and job prospects.\nAlso Read: India’s central bank needs reliable and frequent employment data as a policy input\nEmployment estimates from Periodic Labour Force Surveys continue to indicate a reversal of the economy’s structural transformation, as the country’s count of workers in the agricultural sector has been going up. Even the earnings data remains weak, with a downtrend in the growth rate of casual workers’ wages. This is consistent with evidence from other sources on what Indians at large earn.\nMeanwhile, private-sector data broken up by industry groups also points to a drying up of pent-up demand. This is evident in what consumer goods and automobile companies have reported. The consumer confidence survey of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also shows weak intentions of discretionary spending by urban consumers. Other RBI data also points to an increase in financial vulnerability, with rising retail and gold loans and a decline in household savings.\nClearly, large chunks of data from official surveys and administrative sources are less optimistic on the state of our economy than readings drawn from the National Accounts.\nThe issue is not the credibility of National Accounts data, which has its own limitations, including a 14-year-old base year and other methodological drawbacks.\nAlso Read: Infotech dividend: Going digital could boost India’s labour productivity\nOur broad worry should be that the Indian economy remains fragile. While structural factors such as a demand deficiency and weak investment growth do need policy attention, given the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, particularly with the onset of a tariff war, the challenge of reviving our economy requires a different approach. Policymakers must go beyond headline numbers from the National Accounts.\nThe government needs to squarely address the issues of inadequate job creation and weak incomes (among most workers), while improving public services and pushing up investment in the economy. It must also address our long-standing crisis of agrarian and rural distress.\nThe author is associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University and visiting fellow at the Centre de Sciences Humaines, New Delhi.", "text_len": 5225}

This marks the RBI’s first rate cut in five years and is set to ease the financial burden on retail loan borrowers, especially in the personal and home loan segment.\nThe repo rate is the interest rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks in India. This rate influences the interest rates on different types of loans offered to bank customers, thereby regulating cash flow in the market.\nFollowing the RBI’s decision, at least four public sector banks have adjusted their home loan interest rates. These include State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Maharashtra (BoM), Punjab National Bank (PNB), and Union Bank of India (UBI).\nTable of Contents\nPunjab National Bank revises Rates From February 12\nFrom February 12, PNB is offering personal loans of up to Rs 20 lakh, starting at 11.25%.

Meanwhile, the SBI has cut its home loan rate by 25 basis points to 8.25%. PNB is offering home loans with interest rates starting at 8.15% per annum.\nAccording to the data compiled by Bankbazaar, Bank of Maharashtra's 8.10% is currently the lowest home loan rate available. Canara Bank has also revised its starting home loan rate to 8.15%, down from 8.40%, effective from February 12. Kotak Mahindra Bank, IDFC Home Loan, Axis Bank, and private sector banks remain among the costliest lenders, with rates above 8.75%, Bankbazaar data showed.\n| Bank Name (for home loan) | Interest Rate |\n| SBI | 8.25% p.a. – 9.20% p.a.

Hence, a rate cut by the RBI means relief to borrowers as their EMIs are likely to decrease. For instance, Bank of Baroda customers are set to benefit as the lender has reduced the floating rate car loan by 65 basis points to 8.75%. Similarly, Bank of Maharashtra’s 25 basis point reduction on retail loans also applies to car loans, which has now come down to 8.45% per annum.\nSBI’s standard car loan rates range from 9.2% to 10.15%. Meanwhile, PNB’s revised rates now offer car loans starting at 8.50%. Union Bank has also reduced its starting vehicle loan down to 8.45%. The education and other loans offered by the bank, linked with Repo Linked Lending Rate (RLLR), will also benefit from the change.\nThe decisions related to repo rates are made by the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), tasked with making the country’s monetary policy decision. Earlier this month, the MPC reduced the repo rate to boost economic activity by making borrowing cheaper and encouraging spending.\nAll retail floating-rate loans sanctioned after October 1, 2019, are linked to an external benchmark, which is the repo rate in the case of most banks. Hence, any changes in repo rate directly affect the interest rates on these loans. As a result, banks are required to pass on the full benefit of any rate cuts to borrowers. The central bank’s guidelines also mandate that banks review and adjust their interest rates at least once every quarter.\nTo be clear, the home, personal and loan rates offered by various banks differ from person to person, based on several factors like the borrower’s CIBIL score. This score reflects the creditworthiness of the borrower and their ability to repay loans.\nIf you are looking for the best personal loan offers, explore Moneycontrol app and website for instant loan up to Rs.50 Lakhs with interest rates starting at just 10.5% p.a.\n*All rates are as on 26th Feb 2025.

Net profit will mark a sharp rise from a meagre Rs 40 lakh in FY24.\nâOur revenues have accumulated, and we have not invested massively in marketing or growing our teams. This has helped us keep costs low and the revenue growth is showing in a strong net profit,â said Rohit Prasad, cofounder & managing director, Easebuzz. The company has around 300 employees.\nAlso Read: ETtech Explainer: Why digital payments firms are shutting out third party routers\nInvestors are now looking to partake in the opportunity. Easebuzz is set to close a Rs 350 crore equity infusion round led by US-based venture firm Bessemer Venture Partners in a mix of primary and secondary funding, said two people in the know. The round is expected to catapult the startupâs valuation to around Rs 1,700 crore.\nâSome of its early investors will get an exit, and some of its early employees will also be handsomely rewarded through the round,â said a venture investor who had evaluated the company.\nPrasad did not comment on the funding round. Emailed queries to Bessemer Venture Partners went unanswered.\nEasebuzz benefited from the Reserve Bank of India embargo on most of the large payment aggregators, causing new brands to look at fresh payment solutions. In addition, several banks began referring their current account customers looking for online payments solutions to Easebuzz.\nCurrently 16 banks refer their customers to Easebuzz, said Prasad.\nSME focus\nWhen payment gateways were riding the ecommerce boom, going after direct-to-consumer (D2C) firms, Easebuzz focused on the education sector for digitising fee collections.\nCurrently, the startup has tie-ups with around 10,800 educational institutions who utilise Easebuzz for their digital payments and enterprise software needs.\nThe investor cited above said Easebuzzâs Saas-cum-payments model helped the payment gateway create a moat and a secured revenue channel.\nThis February, the startup got the final payment aggregator (PA) licence from the RBI, bringing it at par with its peers.\nPrasad pointed out that given payments are dominated by UPI, which is not a revenue generating instrument, payment processors need to build software systems for charging their clients.\nâWe know SMEs cannot pay large upfront costs, so we charge 0.2% extra on their GMV (gross merchandise value) which does not pinch them, and in return, they get reliable systems to manage their students, fees and the entire business,â he said.\nEasebuzz currently earns 35% of its revenue from Saas, up from about 10% a year ago. The firm is also entering the big league chasing large enterprise customers to boost transaction volumes. It counts Bajaj Finance, Big Basket and Zepto among 700 enterprise clients. Overall, the platform supports 25,000 monthly active merchants.\nMoving ahead\nPrasad said he wants to grow the business but with a sustainable balance sheet. His ultimate aim is for a public listing by the end of fiscal 2029. Towards this, profit margins need to improve, for which Prasad is looking to add new offerings.\nâWe will be going after the offline payments space with sound boxes and QR codes; we are also looking to apply for a cross border payment aggregator licence to serve international commerce,â he said.\nThe startup is also recognised as a technology service provider (TSP) by NPCI Bharat BillPay.

For instance, Easebuzz has a total payment value (TPV) of $30 billion, compared to Razorpayâs $180 billion.\nCompetition is also stiff for Easebuzz from Razorpay, Cashfree and Pine Labs who are backed by large investors besides having a strong product stack with advanced features.\nPrasad however believes that the bet is twofold. Firstly, small businesses in India will continue to grow and value the software-cum-payments business strategy of Easebuzz. Secondly, the startupâs ability to run a lean operation compared to others will allow it to stay nimble and take on the challenging times ahead.\nAlso Read: Easebuzz secures RBI nod to operate as online payment aggregator\nCompeting with the likes of Razorpay, PayU, Pine Labs and Cashfree, the startup, which has raised only $4 million (about Rs 35 crore) till date, has created a sustainable software services and payments business with a sharp focus on small businesses.\nWhen a regulatory embargo barred payment giants from onboarding new customers for nearly two years till mid-2024, Easebuzz grew its business exponentially for entering the big league.\nThe company is expected to close FY25 with gross revenue of Rs 650 crore, more than double of Rs 294 crore last year. Net profit will mark a sharp rise from a meagre Rs 40 lakh in FY24.\nâOur revenues have accumulated, and we have not invested massively in marketing or growing our teams. This has helped us keep costs low and the revenue growth is showing in a strong net profit,â said Rohit Prasad, cofounder & managing director, Easebuzz. The company has around 300 employees.\nAlso Read: ETtech Explainer: Why digital payments firms are shutting out third party routers\nInvestors are now looking to partake in the opportunity. Easebuzz is set to close a Rs 350 crore equity infusion round led by US-based venture firm Bessemer Venture Partners in a mix of primary and secondary funding, said two people in the know. The round is expected to catapult the startupâs valuation to around Rs 1,700 crore.\nâSome of its early investors will get an exit, and some of its early employees will also be handsomely rewarded through the round,â said a venture investor who had evaluated the company.\nPrasad did not comment on the funding round. Emailed queries to Bessemer Venture Partners went unanswered.\nEasebuzz benefited from the Reserve Bank of India embargo on most of the large payment aggregators, causing new brands to look at fresh payment solutions. In addition, several banks began referring their current account customers looking for online payments solutions to Easebuzz.\nCurrently 16 banks refer their customers to Easebuzz, said Prasad.\nSME focus\nWhen payment gateways were riding the ecommerce boom, going after direct-to-consumer (D2C) firms, Easebuzz focused on the education sector for digitising fee collections.\nCurrently, the startup has tie-ups with around 10,800 educational institutions who utilise Easebuzz for their digital payments and enterprise software needs.\nThe investor cited above said Easebuzzâs Saas-cum-payments model helped the payment gateway create a moat and a secured revenue channel.\nThis February, the startup got the final payment aggregator (PA) licence from the RBI, bringing it at par with its peers.\nPrasad pointed out that given payments are dominated by UPI, which is not a revenue generating instrument, payment processors need to build software systems for charging their clients.\nâWe know SMEs cannot pay large upfront costs, so we charge 0.2% extra on their GMV (gross merchandise value) which does not pinch them, and in return, they get reliable systems to manage their students, fees and the entire business,â he said.\nEasebuzz currently earns 35% of its revenue from Saas, up from about 10% a year ago.

Banks aren’t the villains of this crisis, though. To smoothen welfare payouts, India Post Payments Bank should be put in charge of DBT disbursal.\nWhen millions of Indians cannot afford a ₹10 packet of Parle-G biscuits, how do we expect them to spend ₹100 a month on a 4G SIM card to access their own money? Financial inclusion should mean ease of access. But for many, it has become an uphill battle.\nBank accounts being suddenly frozen due to KYC issues is a growing crisis across India, leaving millions locked out of their savings. While customers blame banks and banks blame regulations, the real issue runs much deeper.\nBanks are bound by regulations, including the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which requires them to track suspicious transactions. They must file suspicious transaction reports when red flags arise.\nAlso Read: KYC exists to prevent fraud and not to make people miserable\nThese indicators may be either probabilistic, such as high transaction volumes, or deterministic, involving a law-enforcement notice, for example. However, the rules do not let banks disclose this to their customers.\nEvery KYC verification comes at a cost. Banks do not just bear routine expenses. They also bear the financial and operational burden of compliance. When the cost of maintaining an account outweighs its value, banks face difficult choices. Rural branches are hit the hardest. They operate on thin margins and are usually understaffed. Yet, they handle a disproportionate number of direct benefit transfer (DBT) accounts.\nWhen the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandates mass re-KYC under the PMLA, these branches struggle with backlogs that take months to clear. Customers, frustrated by frozen accounts, direct their anger at banks, often unaware that the latter have no choice.\nThe rise of fintech and digital banking has also made India a playground for scammers. Reports suggest that money mule networks—for which individuals ‘rent out’ their bank accounts to fraudsters—have proliferated with the ease of UPI transactions. Automated API-driven laundering operations move stolen money at lightning speed.\nAlso Read: The KYC disruption: Investors deserve better than this\nBanks are caught in the middle. When they are pressured by law-enforcement agencies to freeze accounts, their frontline employees often face verbal abuse or physical threats. Yet, the perception is that banks harass customers, even though they are only acting as required by the regulatory regime.\nDBT mechanisms were introduced to curb corruption in welfare distribution. In 2007, Montek Singh Ahluwalia estimated that only 50% of welfare funds reached the poor. Recent field studies by Jean Drèze indicate that things have worsened in 2025, with 69% of DBT-linked bank accounts frozen on account of KYC issues. If beneficiaries cannot access their money, financial inclusion becomes meaningless. This is only slightly different from corruption in in-kind welfare schemes. Yet, it is neither tracked nor acknowledged as a systemic failure.\nIf PMLA-driven KYC norms remain unchanged, then India must rethink its DBT mechanisms. One solution is to have a specialized banking arrangement for welfare payments, separate from commercial banks. India Post Payments Bank could take on this role, given its wide physical presence in rural India.\nAlso Read: Bringing GST under PMLA could lead to tax terrorism\nDedicated DBT bank accounts could process welfare payments. These must not be frozen so long as their holders are alive and could operate with Union government budgetary support rather than relying on commercial viability. Such a shift would reduce the KYC burden on regular banks and let them focus on core financial services.\nDedicated DBT accounts would function differently from regular accounts. Account opening would be automatic, linked to Aadhaar identification and welfare eligibility, and wouldn’t need to meet the demands of traditional bank protocols. Transactions would be limited to government-to-person transfers, preventing third-party fund movements and eliminating the risk of money mules exploiting these accounts.\nUnlike accounts at commercial banks that must be monitored for suspicious activity, DBT-only accounts would need to be watched only for disbursal efficiency.\nSuch a system exists in other countries. Brazil’s Caixa Econômica Federal operates a dedicated welfare-payment system to ensure that benefits reach recipients without banking-bureaucracy delays. India can take a similar approach by expanding India Post Payments Bank into an entity dedicated to welfare transfers.\nIndia also needs policy reforms to shield financial inclusion from financial regulation. Current KYC rules treat every account the same, whether it belongs to a business, an individual investor or a rural pensioner receiving government benefits. This one-size-fits-all approach is flawed. Moreover, freezing an account should be a last resort, not a default response to missing data.\nAlso, RBI and government agencies must coordinate better. Banks cannot be expected to enforce KYC rules while simultaneously ensuring seamless DBT disbursals. A centralized KYC database for DBT beneficiaries managed by a government body, rather than individual banks, would ease much of the compliance burden borne by banks and allow welfare payments to flow smoothly without compromising security.\nBanks are not the villains in India’s KYC crisis. They are bearing the financial, operational and reputational costs of compliance while being pressured by regulators and suffering the ire of customers. If financial inclusion is a priority, the system must evolve. Otherwise, India’s most vulnerable will pay the price for a crisis they did not create.\nThe authors are, respectively, a corporate advisor and independent director on boards; and co-founder, DeepStrat.", "text_len": 6021}

Battered & bruised IT, auto, pharma stocks have a Trump hand\nFoot off the gas pedal\nThe lackluster trade in the auto stocks over the past 6 months has been due to a combination of events. One of the reasons is the below par Q3 earnings by the auto pack.In a brokerage note, Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) highlighted weak earnings by the auto companies. \"The 3Q performance was weak with a 2% YoY dip in profit. Management commentary on FY26 demand was uncertain, with signs of moderation across segments, while the commentary appeared more optimistic about rural demand outpacing urban demand,\" the MOFSL note said.\nWhile the overall bearish sentiments weighed on the markets, for domestic auto stocks, Tesla's entry into India also stoked fear. The US electric vehicle giant has finalised a deal to open its first showroom in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), in what is probably the highest lease rent for a commercial space, a TOI report said.\nGurmeet Chadha, CIO & Managing Partner at Complete Circle Consultants, believes the market reaction is exaggerated: “Markets are overreacting, but this is a time to look at some names where the reaction has been more negative just from the news point of view. Somebody like a Tesla coming will boost the premiumisation of the car story. It is a win-win if an innovator comes.”\nChadha’s view aligns with historical trends—whenever a major global player enters a new market, stocks of incumbents initially decline before stabilizing. Tesla’s arrival could actually accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in India, benefiting local automakers already investing heavily in the segment.\nPrior to this, the Indian government had cut import duty not just for big motorcycles with engines above 1,600cc, but even for small ones.

For two decades, they have been fulfilling their mission while expanding their footprint. Pre-2022, there were periods when delinquency spiked in MFI portfolios, triggered by exogenous shocks. These shocks such as a sharp economic downturn, Covid-19, or local political issues exposed the MFI portfolio to systemic risks. The portfolios bounced back to health once the exogenous shocks subsided.\nHowever, the gradual deterioration of MFI portfolios from 2022 till date is different. There are no external shocks. Arguably, it was specific risks driven by borrowers who ended up having or being given more debt than they can pay back. The current deterioration in MFI portfolio could be primarily attributed to a lapse in risk management practices on the part of at least some entities. As collection efforts by MFIs intensified, sociopolitical interferences crept in over debt collections. But these political moves were not the trigger of the current MFI stress. In the run-up to the current situation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also raised concerns about the underwriting practices and risk appetite of MFIs.\nDespite pockets of excellence, if the typical MFI lender does not improve risk management capability, the portfolio quality is unlikely to improve.\nComplacency of 99% collection\nHistorically, the typical MFI lender would collect 99% or more of the amount outstanding with borrowers. This level of collection efficiency may be the envy of large retail lenders. MFIs in normal times exhibited this performance due to the joint liability group (JLG) mechanism. Here, five to 10 borrowers form a group. This group becomes jointly responsible to ensure that the MFI loans to all members of the JLG are paid back. The JLG tended to minimise borrower-specific risks, while the peer support and pressure ensured low delinquency. However, when systemic risk events impacted all members of a JLG, they would default. The success of the business model in the past as well as spikes in MFI defaults only during black swan events possibly created some hubris.\nLessons not learnt\nThe MFIs have possibly missed the lessons of the retail credit crisis of 2007-08. Back then, few lenders provided small-ticket personal loans (STPLs) with limited background check of the borrowers’ credit history. Further, basic credit scorecards with low predictive power, predominantly judgemental credit policy, and reactive portfolio management aggravated the credit blow-up. Worryingly, a lot of the erstwhile weaknesses of retail lenders are present in MFI lenders. However, after the STPL blow-up in 2007-08, successful retail lenders changed their lending approach. Their decision-making became more date-driven, improved analytical rigour, and raised the standards of credit policy and governance. It has served retail lenders well until of late. MFIs need to travel on that path.\nRegulatory guidelines\nThe RBI has been justifiably worried about some of the lending practices, and thus tightened certain guardrails. This included classifying MFI borrowers as belonging to households with income below `3 lakh per annum. It capped debt service requirement at 50% on monthly income. However, constrained techno-analytical and data infrastructure, at least for a section of MFIs, has prevented comprehensive implementation of such risk guidelines.\nIt is not uncommon to find MFIs who use judgemental or quasi-analytical rule of thumb to assess household incomes. Discretion has remained in the assessment of debt servicing ability, which made some lending decisions suboptimal, ultimately creating over-leveraged borrowers. Further, certain lenders adopted aggressive loan upsell strategies. These loans were often given outside the JLG structure without rigorous assessment of debt servicing abilities. The JLG-imposed credit discipline was breached. Thus, it is not surprising that MFI default rates spiked even where there was no economic shock. Clearly, the sector needs to reinvent itself in terms of its risk management capabilities.\nThe MFI sector needs to work on the following dimensions:\nMore and better data use: For existing customers, the behavioural risk model (B-Score), which is a staple for most retail borrowers, is often missing in MFIs. They need to tap into internal behaviour data better for predicting individual and JLG debt servicing patterns. In India, non-traditional data sources are maturing faster than anticipated. Such sources like locational profiles, payment app behaviours, and satellite data, when used for predicting credit risk, are seen to have predictive power over and above credit bureau data-based models.\nAnalytics need to leapfrog: Seasoned MFI underwriters have astute knowledge of borrower behaviour and locational dynamics. However, this is not institutionalised. Building credit models which marry this institutional insight with advanced data analytical capabilities will provide powerful and explainable credit score. Such transparent risk models may address questions raised by regulators and stakeholders about underwriting quality and risk-based pricing.\nPortfolio monitoring: For a business exposed to macro risks, MFIs typically do not have stress testing models to simulate the loss rates under different scenarios. A stress testing capability can forecast losses at least four to six quarters ahead for alternative macro-economic scenarios. This will enable MFIs to adjust credit policy to minimise losses.\nRisk culture and governance: The lack of digitalisation and weak data analytical capability sometimes breeds poor risk culture and governance. In such set-ups, tracking compliance with regulations and governance norms becomes challenging. The problem is aggravated if lending decisions are predominantly judgemental, supported by broadly defined credit policies. Discretion and opportunistic “cutting the corners” creeps in. Digitalisation of the underwriting process will enhance governance and support risk culture.\nMFIs must make a course correction quickly. An impaired MFI sector will be detrimental to the credit access of the weakest sectors in India.", "text_len": 6405}

It claimed that the bank guarantees submitted by the Hyderabad-based infrastructure company to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) in July 2023 for the twin tunnel project were issued by St Lucia-based Euro Exim Bank, which is neither a scheduled bank, a commercial bank nor a foreign bank recognised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). St Lucia is a tax haven in the Caribbean.\nThe PIL added that MEIL used the allegedly fraudulent bank guarantees to obtain advance payments from the authorities, thereby jeopardising the project and public funds. It further claimed that the authorities knew the bank guarantees were fraudulent but still advanced sums of around ₹1,668.74 crore to MEIL “in an illegal and unlawful manner”.\nResponding to the PIL on Wednesday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the MMRDA, and senior counsel Darius Khambata, representing MEIL, questioned why the petition deserved to be heard. They brought up Velicheti’s post on his X account after the matter was taken up by the court, which they said “shakes the consciousness of the case” and cast aspersions on the integrity of the bench and the parties involved.\nVelicheti’s post on X read: “The ball is in the Mumbai high court, but let’s not kid ourselves, this isn’t a fair match. We’re up against a system that bends, kneels, and prostrates for the rich while trampling anyone who dares to speak up. Thank you, Prashant Bhushan (Velicheti’s lawyer), you’ve never bowed to power. But will the judiciary hold its ground, or will it crumble under the same old weight of political influence, celebrity cadre, and unholy money trails?”\nKhambata said that Velicheti had misused the PIL for his personal benefit, considering the media coverage of the case. He also argued that the journalist had tried to suppress the cases filed against him, which included selling off his company’s trademarks and siphoning off money. Khambata said that according to the rules, parties have to disclose all the litigation against them before filing a PIL. “PIL does not stand for ‘personal’ or ‘publicity’ interest litigation. One cannot invoke their personal interests through it,” he added.\nSenior counsel Mukul Rohatgi, representing MEIL, supported these contentions and stated that Velicheti’s PIL doesn’t deserve a hearing as it scandalises the court’s authority.\nThe Maharashtra government, through advocate general Birendra Saraf, also supported the intervention application, submitting that Velicheti has not only shown scant faith in the judiciary but also spoke about the parties in litigation, which amounts to criminal contempt. He further contended that allowing such PILs would encourage their misuse.\nSenior advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing Velicheti, acknowledged the inappropriate nature of his client’s X post but urged the court not to dismiss the petition solely based on it. “If the court finds the petitioner inappropriate, remove him as a party and appoint an amicus, but don’t brush this issue under the carpet,” he said.\nBhushan also expressed concerns over the defendants’ arguments, stating, “It’s astounding how far one can go to prevent the court from hearing the matter. Four senior advocates, along with the solicitor general, have come together to prevent the court from hearing the petition on merits. When someone exposes the wrongdoings, it becomes easy for the conglomerates to slap defamation suits to deter them to raise their voices.” This indicates that one of the defendants has filed a defamation suit against Velicheti.\nBhushan also refuted the defendants’ argument about Velicheti breaking the rules by not disclosing the cases filed against him. He said that a petitioner is not required to disclose past cases if they are not connected with the current petition.\nAfter hearing both sides’ arguments, the division bench of chief justice Alok Aradhe and justice Bharati Dangre reserved its judgment on the intervention application for a later date.\nStay updated with all the Breaking News and Latest News from Mumbai.

Its underperformance exceeds that of the benchmark indices, with the BSE Sensex and Nifty50 falling 8.4% and 9.3%, respectively.\n“It is difficult to say whether the stocks have corrected enough and made a bottom, but they may be close to a point where they should start consolidating,” market expert Neeraj Dewan said. In an interaction with ET Now, Dewan highlighted that real estate and stock markets tend to move in tandem and that the recent correction in equities has also affected real estate investments.\nIndividually, the steepest fall of 40% has been recorded in Mahindra Lifespace Developers, followed by Prestige Estates Projects and Raymond, which have declined by 36% and 32%, respectively. Others, including Sobha, Godrej Properties, Brigade Enterprises, DLF, The Phoenix Mills, Oberoi Realty, and Macrotech Developers, have corrected between 29% and 4% over the same period.\nAlso Read: Sensex dips 4% during Kumbh Mela.

Citing data, he said that sales are petering and typically when that happens, the pricing power reduces, raising a possibility of discounts.\nWhile Sabharwal is not ruling out a recovery if the overall markets start doing well, he advises caution in the near-term. \"Unless we are finding some compelling value in some stocks which we need to do stock-by-stock, so I have largely kept the sector on the sidelines and not looking at it in the near-term. But potentially at some stage, there will be opportunities,\" he said.\nFor ElaraCapital the risk is on account of non-calibrated supply driving build-up in ready unsold inventory. Moreover, \"uncalled regulatory\" and funding dislocation could drag the financial health of companies, it said. High inflation and interest rate environment is another potential risk that could spoil sentiments according to this brokerage.\nBear grip despite tailwinds\nEarnings boost\nListed real estate companies reported a strong Q3FY25 quarter even as the earnings for the Nifty50 rose 5% year-on-year.\nThe average net profit growth reported by the realty sector in the October-December period stood at 60% YoY according to estimates by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL). In the nine-months ended December 31, 2024, the profit after tax (PAT) growth by real estate companies under MOFSL coverage stood at 57%. This brokerage has also given a 7% earnings upgrade to the sector for FY26E on a TTM basis.\nNo fatigue in residential upcycle\nElaraCapital in a note highlights how Tier 1 cities' residential sales volume (primary market) crossed 1billion square feet ($90 billion) up 40% versus the previous cycle high in FY24.\nThis was on the back of revival in home buyers' confidence following regulatory dislocations like GST, RERA and demonetisation (leading to industry consolidation), this brokerage said. Meanwhile, changing preferences and prioritisation for home ownership post Covid-19 too acted as a strong trigger.\nMany tier-2 cities in India are witnessing average pricing higher than in some tier-1 markets. Listed players like Godrej Properties, Prestige Estates Projects, Purvankara, Sobha, Brigade Enterprises, Ashiana Housing and Keystone Realtors have strong presence in tier-2 cities like Chandigarh, Indore, Nagpur, Kochi, Calicut, Mangalore, Ooty, Thiruvananthapuram, Bhiwadi and Jaipur.\nMumbai, which is a major real estate market, witnessed strong growth in registration in February, recording its best-ever performance in the month, Nuvama said. It expects a robust launch trajectory and mortgage rate cut to likely improve sales in Mumbai going ahead. This will benefit Mumbai-based players—Lodha, Oberoi, Godrej Properties, Rustomjee and Sunteck, this brokerage said.\nLean balance sheet\nSBI Securities highlights asset light models like JDA (Joint Development Agreement) being adopted by many large players which ensures less likelihood of debt-ridden balance sheets. Moreover, big players are mobilising funds via the equity route, it said.\nRBI rate cut\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) delivered its first rate cut of 25 bps in 5 years in February and there is an expectation of another 50 bps slash this year.\nThe move followed some decline in home loan lending rates from banks like SBI, PNB and others.\nSBI Securities remains more optimistic and expects a 75 bps cut over the next 9-12 months.\nAlso Read: OMC stocks up 16% in 4 sessions as crude hits 3-year low, but 4 key risks still loom\nSector Outlook: Stocks to buy\nFor long-term investors, Dewan sees real estate as part of India’s domestic consumption growth story, offering opportunities as the sector stabilises though he remains less certain about an immediate recovery.\nJefferies strategist Christopher Wood remains bullish, asserting that the real estate cycle is far from over. He called the current dip a mid-cycle correction and an opportunity for long-term investment.\nAmong brokerages, Motilal Oswal remains overweight on the sector.\nNotwithstanding the fall, SBI Securities recommends gradual accumulation in stocks like DLF, Macrotech, Phoenix Mills, Godrej Properties, Sunteck Realty and Brigade Enterprises.\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

{"url": "https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/why-international-etfs-are-trading-at-a-premium-and-how-investors-can-avoid-overpaying/articleshow/118658763.cms", "title": "Why international ETFs are trading at a premium and how investors can avoid overpaying", "seendate": "20250302T153000Z", "domain": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "query": "(RBI OR \"Reserve Bank of India\") sourcelang:English sourcecountry:IN", "fetched_at": "2025-09-14T19:40:06.128668", "text": "Why Are International ETFs Trading at a Premium?\nThe primary reason behind the price distortion is regulatory restrictions. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) impose strict limits on overseas investments by mutual funds. According to these guidelines, Indian mutual funds can invest a total of $7 billion in foreign equities, with a separate sub-limit of $1 billion for international ETFs. These caps have remained unchanged for nearly a decade.These limits were reached in 2022, leading SEBI to instruct asset management companies (AMCs) to stop accepting fresh inflows into these ETFs. While existing ETF units continue to trade on the stock exchange, AMCs can no longer issue new units to meet fresh demand. This creates a supply crunch while investor interest continues to grow, causing ETF prices to exceed their NAVs.\nThe Impact of Premiums on Returns\nAn ETF’s price should ideally align with its NAV, which represents the aggregate value of its underlying assets. However, the demand-supply mismatch has led to substantial price premiums, impacting investor returns.For example, if an ETF has an NAV of Rs 100 but trades at Rs 115, new investors must generate an additional 15% return just to break even. This premium effectively reduces potential gains and exposes investors to heightened downside risk if ETF prices correct.\nCurrently, all six international ETFs in India are trading at a premium:\nThe Risks of Buying ETFs at a Premium\nHistorically, ETF premiums have stayed within a 5% range, but recent demand surges have pushed them to uncomfortable levels. While some ETFs may see their prices and NAVs converge within days, others might take up to 240 days. In most cases, price convergence happens within a year, meaning investors who bought at a premium could suffer losses in the short term.How to Track and Avoid ETF Premiums\nTo avoid overpaying, investors should compare an ETF’s trading price with its indicative NAV (iNAV), which reflects the real-time value of its underlying holdings. Fund houses update iNAVs frequently on their websites and stock exchanges like the BSE.If an ETF’s trading price consistently exceeds its iNAV, it’s a clear indication that the fund is trading at a premium. In such cases, investors should reconsider their entry points or use limit orders instead of market orders to avoid overpaying.\nA Smarter Alternative: Investing Directly Through LRS\nFor investors looking to bypass these ETF premiums, a viable alternative exists: direct overseas investment through the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS). Under LRS, Indian investors can remit up to $250,000 per year to invest in global markets.By investing directly in US-listed ETFs or stocks, investors can avoid paying inflated premiums and ensure their purchase price closely matches the actual value of the assets. This approach not only improves potential returns but also provides greater flexibility in asset selection.\nShould You Avoid International ETFs?\nDespite their drawbacks, international ETFs remain a convenient way to gain exposure to global markets. However, investors must be cautious when premiums are high.If you choose to invest through ETFs, consider:\n- Using limit orders to avoid overpaying.\n- Monitoring regulatory updates, as an increase in SEBI’s overseas investment limits could reduce ETF premiums in the future.\n- Waiting for price corrections or exploring direct investment via LRS.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe current premiums on international ETFs highlight a key challenge in global investing—regulatory constraints creating artificial supply-demand imbalances. While ETFs offer an easy route to diversification, their inflated prices reduce returns and increase risks. Investors should carefully assess NAV premiums before buying and explore direct investment options through LRS for a more cost-effective approach.In investing, knowledge is power. By understanding ETF premiums and NAV convergence, investors can make informed decisions and maximize their global investment potential without unnecessary costs.\n(The author of the article is Viram Shah, Founder & CEO, Vested Finance)\n(Catch all the Mutual Fund News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Mutual Fund News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 4531}

The proposed legislation seeks to provide relief to borrowers by discharging loans taken from unlicensed microfinance institutions (MFIs) and preventing coercive recovery measures.\nAccording to the bill, borrowers would no longer be required to repay loans, including interest, taken from unlicensed MFIs. It states, “Every loan, including the amount of interest, if any, payable by the borrower to the MFIs which are unlicensed and unregistered, shall be deemed to be wholly discharged. No civil court shall entertain any suit or proceeding against the borrower for the recovery of any amount of loan including interest.”\nAdditionally, all legal cases against borrowers for loan recovery will be closed. Unregistered MFIs will be prohibited from demanding securities, such as pledges or pawns, in exchange for loans. The legislation also proposes penalties for violations, including imprisonment of up to 10 years and fines up to ₹5 lakh, aligning with deterrence measures seen in financial laws such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002.\nLaw and parliamentary affairs minister HK Patil introduced the bill, emphasising the need for regulatory oversight on unregistered lenders. “It is justified because unlike banks, unregistered lenders operate without regulatory oversight and often acquire securities through coercion,” he said.\nTo standardise lending practices, the bill has mandated that MFIs adhere to transparent pricing structures, limiting charges to four components: interest, processing fees, insurance premiums, and penalties for late payments. Lenders must issue loan cards in Kannada, detailing interest rates, repayment terms, and borrower details. Additionally, all MFIs must establish a registered office in their area of operation.\nThe legislation strictly bans coercive recovery tactics, including threats, intimidation, physical violence, and harassment at borrowers’ homes or workplaces. The use of private recovery agencies is also prohibited. The government defends these measures as necessary for protecting vulnerable borrowers and upholding principles of social justice and economic fairness.\nThe bill requires all MFIs in Karnataka to register with district authorities within 30 days of its enactment. Registration, valid for one year, must be submitted to the district’s Registration Authority. To mediate disputes between lenders and borrowers, the bill also proposes appointing an ombudsperson.\nGovernor Thawar Chand Gehlot approved the ordinance on March 6 after initially returning it on February 7 with concerns over its impact on legal loan recovery. He questioned whether the provision waiving loans and interest from unlicensed MFIs might interfere with the rights of legitimate lenders to recover debts through legal means. Additionally, he highlighted potential constitutional violations under Articles 19 and 32, which guarantee access to legal remedies.\nHe also raised concerns about the severity of penalties, particularly the imposition of a ₹5 lakh fine when microfinance loans are typically capped at ₹3 lakh. The government responded, clarifying that penalties target coercive recovery tactics rather than loan amounts.\nIn response, a senior home department official stated, “The government said that unlicensed and unregistered lenders charging excessive or penalty interest are acting unlawfully, and such loan practices are illegal. The government and courts do not entertain such loan recovery practices.”\nThe ordinance applies only to unregistered MFIs, while those regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or the central and state governments remain unaffected. According to government estimates, ₹60,000 crore has been disbursed through registered MFIs to 1.09 crore borrowers, whereas unregulated lenders have provided approximately ₹40,000 crore in loans, though exact records are unavailable.\nThe ordinance mandates MFIs to register with district collectors and report their interest rates, borrower details, and outstanding loans. Lenders must also submit quarterly and annual business reports. Non-compliance could result in imprisonment for up to six months or a fine of ₹10,000.\nTo prevent coercive recovery methods, the ordinance enforces strict penalties. “Any individual engaging in coercive recovery measures shall face up to 10 years of imprisonment and a fine extending to ₹5 lakh,” the bill states. These offences are categorised as cognisable and non-bailable, ensuring that police cannot refuse to register complaints against violators. The ordinance grants deputy superintendents of police (DySPs) or higher-ranking officers the authority to file cases suo moto against offenders.\nFurther safeguards mentioned in the bill include the appointment of ombudsmen to resolve disputes. The government retains the power to issue additional directives to ensure proper implementation of the ordinance. Officials have justified the law as a step toward regulating microfinance operations while offering relief to borrowers struggling with financial distress.\nThe state government was compelled to introduce the ordinance following multiple distressing incidents linked to aggressive loan recovery tactics. One such case involved a borrower from Raichur district, who reportedly died by suicide after being harassed by an unregistered lender over loan repayment. His widow later staged a symbolic protest by sending her mangalsutra to home minister G Parameshwara, demanding justice for her husband.", "text_len": 5860}

Current economic dynamics also suggest we’ll see a strategic change in stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative’.\nIn a widely anticipated move to balance the objectives of growth and inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced its repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 6.25% at the 7 February meeting of its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which voted unanimously for this cut.\nThis reflects a proactive but calibrated approach to support an economic recovery, while staying focused on gradually aligning Consumer Price Index inflation with its mandated target of 4%. The MPC’s forward-looking approach is commendable, especially given the long lags of policy transmission.\nThat rate cut came on the back of several liquidity-easing measures announced on 27 January, reinforcing RBI’s intent to provide a boost to domestic demand.\nAlso Read: Despite RBI's rate cut, spurring GDP growth is an uphill task\nWhile the central bank refrained from introducing additional liquidity measures on 7 February, it announced more liquidity support soon after, enhancing the quantum of open-market-operation purchases and daily variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, coupled with additional 49-day and 45-day VRR auctions of ₹150,000 crore and a 3-year buy-sell forex swap of $10 billion.\nRBI is expected to announce more open market operations and VRR auctions in the coming months. A large dividend payout to the government, expected in May, will also inject liquidity into the system.\nGovernor Sanjay Malhotra’s assurance that RBI will remain vigilant in managing liquidity underscores the central bank’s dual focus on macro stability and growth. Its decision to hold the cash reserve ratio (CRR) steady at 4%—after a 50-bps cut in December—was prudent as a buffer must be maintained in case of an economic shock. This approach lets RBI retain flexibility.\nLooking ahead, RBI is expected to deliver another 25-bps rate cut in its April policy review, bringing the repo rate down to 6.0%. This is likely to be accompanied by a shift in its monetary policy stance from ‘neutral’ to ‘accommodative,’ signalling a deeper commitment to growth support. The timing of this stance change would be strategic. By waiting until April, RBI can align its liquidity stance more closely with its rate stance, ensuring consistency in its framework.\nAn April stance change could signal either a deeper and longer rate-cutting cycle or a will to improve liquidity conditions further so that short-term rates stay between the repo and standing deposit facility rates, with the former acting as the ceiling rather than floor.\nWe lean more towards the second possibility, expecting RBI to deliver an effective easing of 25bps through the liquidity route after having delivered a 50bps rate cut through February and April. Then the effective easing will amount to 75bps.\nRBI is unlikely to cut the repo rate beyond 50bps in this cycle, given the global economic backdrop and domestic growth-inflation dynamics. With the US Federal Reserve having cut rates by only 100bps in 2024 and no further cuts expected in 2025, RBI would remain cautious. Its GDP growth estimate of 6.7% for 2025-26, coupled with an inflation projection of 4.2%, suggests that a 50bps repo rate cut and effective easing of 75bps will be adequate in this cycle.\nAlso Read: Rupee lesson: The impossible trinity is getting the better of us\nExcessive rate cuts could risk destabilizing this balance, potentially necessitating a quicker reversal of easing measures, which would be counterproductive. A front-loaded rate-cutting strategy reduces the need for deeper cuts later in the cycle. This approach, combined with fiscal support such as ₹1 trillion in tax cuts and sustained capital expenditure, is expected to narrow the negative output gap without stoking demand-side inflation.\nThe coordinated efforts of fiscal and monetary policies are poised to sustain non-inflationary real GDP growth in a range of 6.5-7.0% in 2025-26.\nThe rupee’s trajectory under Governor Malhotra’s RBI leadership is likely to see more two-way movement, reflecting market dynamics. While we forecast the rupee to end at 88 to the dollar by December 2025, near-term volatility cannot be ruled out, especially if global trade tensions escalate. RBI is likely to keep its monetary and forex policies separate, which could help ensure that exchange rate management does not undermine domestic policy goals.\nGradual and modest rupee depreciation is not necessarily a bad thing. It could boost exports and growth on the margin, without significantly exacerbating India’s imported inflation risks. RBI’s 4.2% inflation projection for 2025-26 appears realistic and aligns closely with private forecasts of 4.3%. Even with an effective easing of 75bps, real rates are expected to remain positive by 1.5%, providing ample room for RBI to support growth without compromising price stability.\nAlso Read: Mint Quick Edit | A rupee slide needn’t be bad for India\nWhile RBI’s growth forecast of 6.7% for 2025-26 is slightly above consensus estimates of 6.5%, it is below the economy’s potential growth rate of 7% or more. This underscores the need for coordinated fiscal and monetary support to bridge the output gap. Notwithstanding the volatility inherent in quarterly GDP data, the broad narrative is unchanged: the economy needs some policy support to achieve its full potential.\nRBI’s February policy marked a successful start to Governor Malhotra’s tenure, striking a delicate balance between growth and price stability. By delivering an optimum dose of monetary easing, the central bank has reinforced its commitment to fostering a resilient and dynamic economy. Coupled with the government’s growth-oriented fiscal policy, this approach sets the stage for a robust economic recovery in the quarters ahead, ensuring that India remains on a path of sustainable and inclusive growth.\nThe author is chief economist, India, Malaysia, and South Asia at Deutsche Bank AG.", "text_len": 6154}

Then quit. There's no point in being a fool about it.'\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

There is a crack in the structure of the world’s fastest-growing major economy. Speeding up subprime loans could be risky down the road.\nEffective April 1, banks will set aside less capital on loans to better-rated nonbanking financial companies. The monetary authority has also lowered the risk weights on microfinance loans for consumer credit to 100%, restoring them to their pre-November-2023 levels. Back then, Shaktikanta Das, the former RBI chief, had raised the weights to 125%.\nThe capital thus freed up could fuel banks’ own lending. The sharp downtrend in their advances to shadow lenders — who ultimately serve less creditworthy borrowers — should also reverse.\nBoth of those outcomes will be timely. Gross domestic product may have grown 6.5% in the year that ends March 31, according to the government’s estimates, slowing from 9.2% in the previous 12 months. The next year’s forecast doesn’t herald much of a pickup, either.\nAnd those official statistics may not be capturing the full extent of the funk in consumer demand in urban areas where wages are stagnant, and jobs are under threat from artificial intelligence. Amid a $900 billion rout in the stock market, and with US President Donald Trump’s trade war creating uncertainty for output, prices and interest rates globally, it’s understandable that policymakers want credit to flow more easily.\nYet Malhotra must know that his recent move is just a temporary solution. The 8% GDP growth that authorities say they want to sustain — to propel a lower-middle-income economy to a developed one — will need a more concrete foundation than a hole filled with consumer credit.\nEight years ago, banks and finance companies gave out 2.5 million advances of less than 100,000 rupees ($1,150). Last year, there were 122 million of such small-ticket loans, accounting for 88% of all personal credit origination, according to Blume Ventures, a Mumbai-based early stage venture-capital investor that releases a popular annual report. Thanks to rapid digitization, which has quickened credit checks and approvals, finance companies and banks were able to push out $100 billion in new personal loans out the door in 2024, a six-fold jump from 2017.\nThat’s a big addition to household liabilities in a short time. Where’s the appetite for this borrowing coming from?\nThe Blume report offers clues. The richest 30 million households in the most-populous nation have an aggregate purchasing power similar to Mexico’s. Their consumption is powering the economy. The next 70 million, earning about $3,000 per capita annually, are on their way to rivaling Indonesia’s living standards. They are trying to mimic the spending choices of the top earners who are five times richer, on average.\nThe remaining 200 million families — 1 billion people — are India’s equivalent of sub-Saharan Africa, dipping into savings to survive. They have no money for discretionary expenditure.\nThe research doesn’t say it, but my guess is that “India 1,” as the authors term the top consuming class, is financing both the aspirations of “India 2,” and the desperation of “India 3.” The interest payments on the borrowings by the latter two groups is flowing to the first, making it wealthier still. And therein lies the structural flaw in the economy.\nA 2021 paper by economists at Princeton, Harvard and the University of Chicago argues that instead of productive investment, the “saving glut of the rich” Americans — accumulating over four decades — drove “dissaving by the non-rich and dissaving by the government.”\nIt’s possible that something similar is afoot half a world away. Income and wealth distribution in the fifth-largest economy is now more unequal. That would explain the surge in small-ticket personal loans. It would also explain why a middle class stuck in a cycle of mediocre work, poor pay and heavy indirect taxes lost billions of dollars trading options, enriching the likes of Jane Street Group. The derivatives market witnessed a 40-fold jump since 2019 before regulators stepped in to stop the madness.\nNew Delhi, too, has become dependent — not only on the savings glut of the local wealthy, but of rich investors globally. Without the $12 billion it earned from a long-term capital gains tax that even foreigners have to pay, the government’s effective revenue deficit would have been 13% higher in 2022-23. But when that fickle source of tax income comes up short, the axe of deficit reduction may fall on welfare programs. Which would leave poor households more reliant on small-ticket loans that groups of women borrowers can obtain from microfinance firms.\nThat’s the business model of microfinance in India, and it has a crisis once every few years. A recently released report by a government think tank shows a 42%, one-year jump in the number of women borrowers actively monitoring their credit. Much of it may be anxiety about default, passing off as empowerment. While lowering the risk weight on consumer credit via microfinance, the Reserve Bank will hopefully remain alive to the risk.\nWhile he can’t do much about jobs or wages, Malhotra could tell his bosses in New Delhi to stop dreaming about a developed society until they have fixed the corrosive inequality hollowing out the economy’s foundation. The rest is up to them.\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Now, the bank is demanding repayment, even from those who have closed their accounts—raising questions about fairness and retroactive rule enforcement.\nA Gurgaon resident was blindsided by an email from Axis Bank demanding ₹23.25 lakh for excess reward points acquired through a loophole.\n\"Since you have redeemed X excess reward points beyond what is rightfully accrued by your transactions, we request you to pay INR 23,25,639 to the Bank as per MITC clause...\"\nThe notice was part of the bank’s recent effort to recover rewards points accumulated by some credit card holders through a technical loophole in 2023. The recipient had closed his Axis Magnus credit card in December 2023, and is no longer a customer—yet the bank is still pursuing repayment\nThe loophole that sparked a crackdown\nOrdinarily, when a credit card transaction is refunded, the reward points earned on that transaction are reversed. In 2023, Axis Bank failed to do this for cancelled transactions.\nRead this | How small credit card disputes with banks can snowball into major mistrust\nSome customers exploited the oversight. They placed high-value orders on e-commerce platforms, earned the corresponding rewards, and then cancelled the orders. Axis Bank refunded the amounts but did not revoke the reward points.\nIndustry experts say reversing points upon refund is a standard practice across all banks.\nThis glitch persisted for two years before Axis Bank finally fixed it in January 2024, said Sumanta Mandal, founder of TechnoFino, an online platform that reviews banking products such as credit cards.\nNow, Axis Bank is clawing back the excess rewards. It has begun deducting points from affected customers’ Edge Rewards (ER) accounts. In cases where customers lack sufficient points, their ER balances have turned negative—requiring them to pay the shortfall in cash.\n\"Due to a technical issue, EDGE REWARD Points from cancelled/reversed/EMI transactions on your Axis Bank credit card(s) between April ’23 and Jan ’24 were not reversed. These points have now been deducted from your EDGE REWARDS account,\" read an email sent to a customer.\nBank goes after even ex-customers\nCustomers who no longer hold Axis credit cards aren’t exempt. Those with closed accounts have received notices demanding payment based on the valuation of their excess rewards.\nTejas Ghongadi, co-founder of The Points Code, said the bank might post the cash equivalent of the negative points balance on the credit card statements of active cardholders. But for former customers, the path forward remains unclear.\nIt remains unclear how the bank will generate a statement for a closed card if the customer doesn’t pay voluntarily, according to experts. Without an outstanding balance to impact their credit score, former customers may have little incentive to settle the claims.\nAxis Bank, however, has warned that failure to comply may lead to legal consequences.\nIs Axis Bank justified?\nAxis Bank is relying on Clause G of its Most Important Terms and Conditions (MITC) to justify the recovery effort. The clause states that if a cardholder has a negative rewards balance at the time of account closure, the equivalent amount will be converted into a statement debit that must be repaid before the card is officially closed.\nYet critics argue that the rule was introduced after many of these former customers had already shut their accounts.\nRead this | Why banks flag business expenses paid on personal credit cards\nMITC was changed later—this rule didn’t exist when these former customers closed their cards, said Ghongadi. \"The bank’s reconciliation process has been very slow.\"\nA review of older MITC documents supports his claim: the negative rewards balance clause wasn’t present when many of the affected customers shut their accounts.\nSanjeev Moghe, president and head of cards and payments at Axis Bank, said the bank regularly evaluates how customers use credit card benefits.\n\"(W)henever the bank observes a pattern of transactions that amounts to misuse of the benefits, the bank takes an action to discourage inappropriate usage,\" he said.\nExperts are divided on whether the bank can apply a rule retroactively.\n\"This clause didn’t exist in the agreement they signed when they were still customers,\" Mandal said. \"How can the bank charge them retrospectively? If the bank reactivates a closed card, for which the customer would already have an NOC from the bank, the latter can escalate the issue to the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) and even take the matter to consumer court.\"\nGhongadi noted that while the retroactive recovery may violate standard rules, in a few cases it's being done on the grounds of fraudulent behaviour, which the bank may be justified in carrying out.\nMost banks take action against customers when they see credit card rewards being earned through misuse. However, the actions are typically swift and hence taken within the purview of the agreement contract.\nWhat's at stake for customers\nAccording to Axis Bank, fewer than 100 people have received recovery notices. “The number of such identified cards is 72 (0.0004%), which is a miniscule number of the bank's credit card portfolio,\" Moghe said.\nThe bank, however, did not disclose the total amount it aims to recover.\nRead this | Axis Bank has done the unthinkable: Launched a credit card it doesn’t want everyone to have.\nCurrent cardholders will see the recovery amount reflected in their credit card statements. Experts advise that those considering a challenge should first pay the balance to avoid credit score damage before filing a complaint with the banking ombudsman.\nFor some, however, repayment may be financially unfeasible. In three such cases, emails reviewed by Mint show recovery amounts of ₹42.26 lakh, ₹7.2 lakh, and around ₹6 lakh—excluding the ₹23.25 lakh demand mentioned earlier.\"\nMandal believes the case boils down to contractual liability rather than morality.\n\"Many will bring up the moral argument that why did customers misuse the reward system in the first place. My question is why didn’t Axis Bank have proper controls in place?\" he said. \"Reversing reward points immediately after a transaction is refunded is a basic functionality. To recover the rewards in retrospection is unfair.\"\nIn banking and finance, Mandal added, contractual agreements override ethical considerations. \"Suppose you take a loan without insurance, meet with an accident and lose your job. Your employer won’t pay you, and the bank won’t spare you—they will still demand repayment. The bank will not think twice before sending a recovery agent to your address.\"\nAlso read | Devaluations are normal. So, why is it hurting Axis credit card holders?\nThis isn’t the first time Axis Bank has pursued customers over alleged misuse of credit cards. In 2023 and 2024, it cancelled cashback cards and suspended reward redemptions for customers suspected of using personal cards for business purposes. Affected individuals were asked to provide invoices and other proof that their transactions were personal.\nGaming the rewards system can be lucrative, but cardholders should refrain as banks always find a way to settle the score.", "text_len": 7354}

This implies a risk-weight decrease of at least 25 percentage points for Bandhan’s and IIB’s MFI loans.\nThe banking regulator started infusing liquidity in a big chunk, first by slashing repo rate, then bringing down the risk weights on microfinance as well as bank loans on NBFCs.\nThe good times for the sector got a helping hand from the indefinitely postponed proposed regulatory tightening (LCR norms and provisions on project financing).\nBandhan Bank’s performance in Q3\nThe lender reported a 42% year-on-year decline in its net profit at Rs 426 crore for Q3 FY25 as against Rs 733 crore in the same period a year ago.

On Wednesday, chief minister Yogi Adityanath stated that Uttar Pradesh's economic growth has outpaced the national average and that the state budget for the next fiscal year serves as a tool to drive development to the last mile.\nPresenting a comprehensive overview of the state's economy in the Legislative Council, the CM asserted that this year's budget reflects the government's strong commitment to accelerating economic growth while increasing per capita income.\nHere are 10 charts that illustrate how Uttar Pradesh has performed in terms of the economy, law and order, and more under eight years of the Yogi Adityanath government.\nEconomic growth and GSDPThe state's economy, which was in a challenging position in 2017, has now doubled, with the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) projected to reach Rs 27.51 lakh crore for the financial year 2024-2025. Per capita income has also seen substantial growth, rising from Rs 52,671 in 2016-2017 to Rs 93,514 in 2023-2024.\nDuring the budget session, finance minister Suresh Kumar Khanna stated, \"According to a report by the Reserve Bank of India, Uttar Pradesh's share of tax receipts among all states is among the highest in the country, reflecting strong financial management.\"\nThe per capita NSDP showed a steady upward trajectory, indicating stable economic growth. The per capita NSDP was record high in 2023-24 reflecting strong financial health and increased income levels in the state.\nThe analysis of per capita availability of power showed a steady increase in power availability over the years. The highest per capita power availability has been achieved in 2023-24, showcasing continued improvements in electricity distribution and generation capacity.\nThe data also showed a rapid increase in capital expenditure, suggesting a strong push toward infrastructure development and economic revival.\nThe social sector expenditure from 2014-15 to 2023-24, showed a steady increase over the years, with a sharp rise from 2021-22 onwards.\nTop 5 districts and their GSDP contribution- Gautam Budh Nagar (10%) â Home to Noida, this district is the leading contributor due to its strong industrial base, IT sector, and corporate presence.\n- Lucknow (4%) â The state capital, driven by government services, retail, real estate, and the IT sector.\n- Agra (3.5%) â Known for tourism (Taj Mahal), handicrafts, and manufacturing.\n- Prayagraj (3.3%) â A center for education, administration, and tourism.\n- Meerut (3%) â A hub for sports goods manufacturing, the metal industry, and trade.\nThe rural unemployment saw a sharper spike in 2017-18 but recovered faster, likely due to government interventions.\nCrime and punishment\nWith a major crackdown by Yogi government against crime in the state, Uttar Pradesh's overall crime rate came down lower than the national average.\nThe charge-sheeting rate in UP is also higher than the national average, which suggests that more cases are being formally prosecuted.\nThe government has also worked on educational infrastructure with and the state now has 67 universities, 5,842 colleges, 3,268 ITIs/ITCs and 370 polytechnics.\nThe male literacy rate is at 81.8 per cent while that of female is 63.4 per cent.", "text_len": 3377}

Launched with much fanfare in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first tenure in 2014 to accelerate financial inclusion, the PMJDY has as many as 530 million accounts — over one-third of India’s population — and has crossed several milestones over the years.\nOn the very first day, 15 million accounts were opened, over 30 million in a month and 75 million by January 26, 2015. Stiff targets had to be met in an extraordinarily short time — the usual template of ambitious projects. Given the pressure to deliver, there would certainly have been lapses in the initial KYC process. After a decade, those lapses have come back to haunt the banking sector as well as the beneficiaries. And it is already showing in the number of inoperative accounts, which stands at 110 million or 21%.\nThe more worrying aspect is the increasing number of accounts getting frozen, implying people being denied access to their savings, due to KYC issues. As field studies by Jean Drèze in four villages in Jharkhand has shown, 69% of households have been denied access to at least one bank account. What makes these Jan Dhan accounts important are three things: Direct benefit transfer (DBT) from government, insurance, and credit. Of course, the blame game has begun. Customers blame banks, banks blame regulations, and the Reserve Bank of India blames the rising number of “mule” accounts.\nThe last one is an extremely serious issue. With the rise of the fintech industry and digital banking, the number of people using the Unified Payments Interface route to commit frauds has been increasing at a fast clip. Last year, Paytm Payments Bank was shut down due to money laundering by some its customers. And for many years, scamsters have “rented out” bank accounts to invest in initial public offerings or stock markets. Last month, the home minister said that the government had identified as many as 1.9 million mule accounts and prevented suspicious transactions worth `2,038 crore.\nObviously, the threat of account misuse is real. But so is the need to ensure that the poor, dependent on government doles, are not denied their dues. It’s not that the government is unaware of the challenges. In November, M Nagaraju, secretary of the department of financial services, in a meeting with stakeholders, emphasised the importance of using all available means such as fingerprints, facial recognition, and others across various channels for re-KYC. He also urged banks to replicate the zeal they demonstrated during the PMJDY launch, and complete the process in a timely manner, even if it meant deploying additional staff. But putting pressure on the banking system, once again, is not the solution.\nThe government needs to take the responsibility this time. For example, create a separate depository or data base of bank accounts dependent on welfare schemes. These accounts have to be monitored by a separate body for usage, require minimum KYC (Aadhaar-enabled), and must allow only government-to-beneficiary transfers. This separation will serve two purposes — take the pressure away from banks, especially their rural branches, and reduce their exploitation as mule accounts. Managing 530 million bank accounts is a humungous task. But even if 0.5% to 1% of beneficiaries are denied their dues, it will be grossly unfair. With great decisions comes greater responsibility.", "text_len": 3508}

They give stable returns for a long period.\nBenefits:\n-Safe investment with government guarantee\n-Better interest rate than FD\n-Tax exemption in some bonds\nDisadvantages:\n-Long lock-in period\n-If interest rates rise in the market, the value of old bonds may decrease\n-Limited early withdrawal facility\n-Moderate-risk FD options\n4 High dividend-yielding stocks\nIf you want to earn regular income by taking a little risk, then investing in dividend-paying blue-chip stocks can be a good option.\nAdvantages:\n-Income from regular dividends\n-Capital appreciation is possible if the stock price rises\n-Blue-chip companies provide stability\nDisadvantages:\n-A fall in the stock market will affect the stock price\n-Dividends are not guaranteed\n-Stocks need to be chosen carefully\n5 Gold Investments (ETFs, Gold Bonds, Physical Gold)\nGold has always been considered the most reliable way to protect against inflation. You can invest in physical gold, gold ETFs or sovereign gold bonds (SGB).\nBenefits:\n-Excellent way to protect against inflation\n-No hassle of storage in gold ETFs and bonds\n-High liquidity (can be sold anytime)\nDisadvantages:\n-Does not give regular income\n-Problem of storage and security of physical gold\n-Gold prices may fluctuate\n-Slightly higher risk but good return options\nAlso read: Income Tax Department investigating unlisted share transactions, tax evasion in OFS deals: Report\n6 Annuity Plans (Pension Schemes)\nIf you are planning for retirement and want a guaranteed income for life, then annuity plans can be the right choice.\nBenefits:\n-Guaranteed income for life or a fixed period\n-Safe investment\n-Excellent option for pension planning\nDisadvantages:\n-Liquidity becomes very low once the money is invested\n-Ability to beat inflation is limited\n-Some plans may charge higher fees\n7 SWP in Mutual Funds (Systematic Withdrawal Plan)\nIf you want regular income like FD but want to beat inflation along with tax savings, then the SWP option of mutual funds can be the best.\nBenefits:\n-More tax-effective than FDs\n-Ability to beat inflation\n-Withdrawal facility (you can decide when and how much to withdraw)\nDisadvantages:\n-Market downturns will affect investments\n-Choosing the right fund is important\n-Not right for ultra-conservative investors\nConclusion:\nFDs may be a safe investment, but their interest rates do not beat inflation. If you want better returns with less risk, then post office schemes and government bonds can be good options. On the other hand, gold, and mutual fund SWPs can prove to be better for higher returns.\nInvest according to your goals and risk appetite to put your money in the right place. By adopting the right strategy, you can earn even higher returns than FDs.", "text_len": 5053}

Deeply ingrained in Mizo culture, Chapchar Kut marks the period when freshly cut bamboo and trees are left to dry before being burned for jhumming (slash-and-burn farming).\nWith agricultural work on pause, Mizo ancestors embraced this time for leisure, indulging in hunting, fishing, and vibrant festivities. Historians trace the festival’s origins back to 1450–1600 A.D., during the era when Mizo forefathers resided in Lentlang.\nRecommended Stories\nWhy Is March 7 A Bank Holiday in Aizawl?\nThe Government of Mizoram has officially declared Chapchar Kut 2025 as a public holiday through a formal notification: “Chapchar Kut, 2025 is to be celebrated as a one-day event on 7th March 2025 (Friday) throughout the state. However, in the state capital, it will be observed as a two-day event at AR Lammual, Aizawl, on 6th and 7th March 2025.\"\nAccording to Reserve Bank Of India, March 7 will be a bank holiday in Aizawl under the Negotiable Instruments Act.\nAll You Need To Know About The Festival Of Mizoram\nHistory Of Chapchar Kut\nIn its earliest days, Chapchar Kut lasted for several days, with well-structured preparations leading up to the grand celebration. Every villager had a role to play, but it was the youth who took centre stage, ensuring that the festival was filled with boundless energy and enthusiasm.\nTo uphold the spirit of the occasion, all conflicts were resolved beforehand, even minor disagreements between married couples. The festival demanded an abundance of food and home-brewed liquor, ensuring that spirits remained high as the community danced and made merry through the night.\nChapchar Kut In Modern Times\nWhile the modern-day celebration of Chapchar Kut has shed the tradition of liquor consumption, the fervour remains undiminished. Mizoram, being a dry state for years, has embraced an alcohol-free celebration, with the Young Mizo Association (YMA) playing a key role in organising the festivities.\nThe younger generation has found its own way to keep the excitement soaring—live performances by Mizo pop artists electrify the crowd, sending even the most composed onlookers into a frenzy of dance.\nFrom toddlers to uniformed policemen meant to maintain order, everyone sways to the infectious beats, fully immersed in the joy of the festival.\nThe Grand Finale: Chai Dance\nAs the festival reaches its crescendo, the final act—Chai dance—brings everyone together. Standing in circles, participants sway gently to the soulful melodies of Mizo folk songs. The sight is heartwarming; even tourists, both domestic and international, step forward to join the revelry. In that moment, all barriers of culture, religion and nationality dissolve into the shared joy of dance.\nMizoram, a state known for its warmth and hospitality, once again proves why it is celebrated as one of the most peaceful places in India.\nChapchar Kut 2025: Wishes\n- Wishing the people of Mizoram a joyous and vibrant Chapchar Kut!\n- Best wishes to all celebrating this wonderful festival of unity and happiness.\n- May your cattle stay healthy, your fields flourish and your homes be filled with abundance. Happy Chapchar Kut!\n- Celebrate tradition, embrace happiness and spread joy.

In its 360th year now---from 1665 when it was transferred to the English---this port town has come a long way. Think of Bombay circa 1925, and imagine the skyline marked by green treetops on hills and mill chimneys on the plains. Come 2025, it's Greater Mumbai, in real-time, with a Display Picture (DP) of erections reaching for the skies.\n\"Mumbai is a land starved city\" is a clichÃ© used so very often to justify building high. The danger in high density high-rise development is not really âup there' but âdown here'. While the notion of going vertical seems to uplift the imagination and distance one's mind from the problems on the ground, is it solving them? Not really. And maybe it is burdening them further.\nIn Mumbai, many high-rise towers are bereft of context. Rarely does an architect address the site in relation to its immediate surroundings. Whether the building is compatible with the ground is too much to ask for, perhaps, when the designs are not even sky driven. There was a time when real estate advertisements did not show buildings but solitary clouds (or smoke?), stacked one above the other, floating in a barren sky.\nThere have been innovative models of high-rise architecture in other parts of the world. The Linked Hybrid project in Beijing, designed by Architect Stephen Holl, connects skyscraper blocks through a street at an upper floor. The iconic Marina Bay Sands project in Singapore by Architect Moshe Safdie shows the possibility of taking amenities and recreational areas towards a common rooftop, connecting terrace spanning over three different high-rise blocks. Not to miss the popular Interlace, also in Singapore, designed by Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) and Ole Scheeren. The Interlace's 1000-plus residential units could have been an example of cluster redevelopment for large sites such as Mumbai's BDD Chawls.\nBut back in Mumbai, too, there are some notable examples of early skyscrapers. The city's first apartment tower, âUsha Kiran' and Charles Correa's âKanchanjunga', which features on the global map of architectural recognition. Then there's âWoodlands', which lies across the road and âPetit Towers', next to the early 20th century F D Petit Sanatorium, all on Cumballa Hill. These are being dwarfed by new towers emerging under current Development Plan (DCPR-2034).\nAmong other older high-rises in congested heritage precincts, Jejeebhoy Towers of the Bombay Stock Exchange in the Fort area stands apart for its engineering and its curving exterior envelope set back on a podium that respects the original footprint and height from the pedestrian eye level. Not so the Reserve Bank of India slab-like block towering next to the Town Hall.\nAs this is being written, there are visible signs of more towers sprouting in the Fort area heritage precinct. Under DCPR-2034, the incentive to build is given on almost any plot in a one-size-fits-all manner. It is not only utilities like transport, power, water, etc that need consideration but the human safety. Are high-rise buildings in dense localities like the Fort precinct symbolic of the misplaced priorities for development in Mumbai? Policy is where the problem lies. From need-based supply, the additional \"free\" area is moving to a greed-oriented demand in housing. Greater Mumbai today is branding \"redevelopment\".\nThere are almost shoulder-touching towers with multilevel parking in localities where walk-up flats once stood in a harmony of scale and walkable proximity to public transport. (In planned layouts such as the Hiranandani Complex at Powai, the towers are given space in between.) And there is the incentive of cluster development, which pools together adjoining plots to build gated complexes that rehouse the population of the neighbourhood without providing essential social amenities and road widening.\nLest we forget, the higher the rise, the harder the fall.\nBefore the city wakes up to reality, it will be 2034, the time for the next DP, viz. Development Plan. (Or is it Dirty Picture in realty, with its current competition for \"Tall, taller, tallest.\") If the first Development Plan of 1967 introduced the concept of FSI (Floor Space Indices), the second of 1991 brought in additional built-up area through TDR (Transferable Development Rights) and the recent DP of 2017, to be implemented by 2034, is all about âpromoting' (the P in DPCR) development any which way, the next DP shall have to focus on Demolition. Greater Mumbai's skyline then will be most difficult to bring down to earth softly.\nHarshad Bhatia is an urban designer, architect, author and academic based in Mumbai.", "text_len": 4731}

What the Finance Ministry bureaucracy needs to do is cast the net wider.\nAs at March 31,’24, there were 74.67 crores PAN Cards issued of which 98% were individual PAN Cards. Individual PAN Card Holders are therefore around 73 Crores in numbers. However, the Income Tax Returns filed by individuals for year 2023/24 were 8.09 crores – 11% of individual PAN Card Holders filed their income tax returns. Excluding agriculture income of large farmers is a disastrous decision for collecting individual income tax.\nFrom the AIS reports of individuals, one can easily make out who are the persons who had income tax deducted or collected at source but did not file their income tax returns. The large value TDS / TCS individuals who have not filed income tax returns, should be the Tax Dept focus, if there is an intent to expand the income tax coverage.\nAn opportunity to simplify the Income Act for individuals was lost thru the Section 87A rebate amendment. Under both the old method and new method on individual income tax, the base limit could have been kept at Rs 12 lakhs and then the tables of income slabs and rates of tax could have been constructed. Why give a benefit so grudgingly, when the benefit is well deserved and overdue?\nInterestingly at the Gross income Tax collection levels, non-corporate income tax payers are projected to pay more income tax than corporate tax payers. The Budget Estimate for year 2025-26 projects non-corporate tax payers to be paying Rs 14,38,000 crores of income tax against Rs 10,82,000 crores of corporate tax. This is a surprising number but as highlighted above, the non-corporate income tax collection is a half baked tax collection effort. With proper efforts in place to catch the ones who are not filing income tax returns, the estimated non-corporate income tax could double, giving great relief to income tax collector and income tax payer.\nThere is another source of income revenue that the Country and Finance Ministry are not focused on. The discussion is on Dividends and Profits received by the Central Government from Public sector enterprises and other bodies like Reserve Bank of India, etc. The latest Budget projects Dividends and Profits income at Rs 3,25,000 crores. In my view, this is a paltry figure.\nThe real value of this income can be derived by looking at the amount that the Central Govt has invested into public sector units in terms of share capital, loans and advances (often to fund the losses of Central Public sector enterprises – CPSE). For the year ended March 31, 2024 let us know what is the amount invested by the Central Govt into Central Public Sector Entities thru Share Capital, Loans and Advances. Considering that the audited accounts for year ended March 31, ’24 should be completed, the numbers should not be very difficult to compute. Against this Application of Funds, let us test the return to the Central Govt by way of ‘Dividends and Profits’. I am convinced that the % Return would be dismal.\nOne way of addressing the Budget shortfalls and inability to put greater investments into Defence, Infrastructure, social welfare schemes is to get adequate Returns on Government investments from CPSEs. We need to take a severe review of this source of revenue, which is always under the radar. Individual income tax is the only thing that everybody is focused on.\nThere is a need to focus our attention in Budgeting from Sources of Funds to Application of Funds. Divestment as an exercise is not popular and faces resistance. That is why year after year, the divestment proceeds revenue keeps dropping on the Projections side. We need to make a change in our Finance and Industry related Ministries (Shipping, Banking, Insurance, Transport, Ports, etc) thinking – for Tax payer money that is invested into Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). There needs to be a proper positive Return so that the Tax Payer tax contribution funds additional new essential activities. Tax payer contribution MUST BE managed better.\nMaybe, we need something like a DOGE (USA) to really make out a new construct on public sector working, funding, efficiency computation and performance targets setting. Ministries should be responsible for CPSE units under them. Too much wastage in Central Govt programmes is tolerated and not attended to.\nIt is my belief after watching Investments being made in the past – that the private sector has lost it’s zest for investment. It can never be the Leader. It will always be the follower of Government investment. There are honorable promoter exceptions but very few. Most private sector promoter groups are followers and that is why we are seeing the consolidation stage in private businesses. The aggressive promoters are buying the less performing units in their business space. However, in the absence of new capacity creation, the Nation does not benefit from additional capacity creation.\nThe focus of the Central Govt Budget exercise should be on three issues:\n- Increase the number of individual income tax returns being filed and make the income tax law more egalitarian and applicable to all. The existing narrow individual income tax filers base will not yield enough in future;\n- Get Returns on investment made into assets (central public sector units). This is the heart of the Budget revenue exercise to fund increased infrastructure, defence and social welfare spendings;\n- Create a Budget monitoring team such that there are no performance slippages and better costs management.\nDisclaimer\nViews expressed above are the author's own.\nTop Comment\n{{A_D_N}}\n{{C_D}}\n{{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}}...

Rather than making rational evaluations you tend to ignore the obvious red flags and pitfalls as you driven more by possible sense of accomplishment of owning a house. This is what happened to many homebuyers of Delhi NCR when they went for home loan EMI subvention scheme offered by many builders and developers a decade ago.\nAccording to TOI, subvention schemes were supposed to make things easier for buyers, but in many cases, became instruments that gave builders access to loans without accountability and left homebuyers in the city to bear the aftershocks, like demand letters to pay EMIs despite houses running years behind schedule.\nAlso read | How an easy home loan EMI scheme turned into a nightmare for many homebuyers in Delhi NCR\nIt differs as how is the house financed. The loan is taken by the realtor directly from the bank. The realtor pays a pre-EMI till the time of possession. But this EMI is only on the interest component. The buyer begins to pay EMI on the principal and the rest of the interest component after possession. The delivery timeline is typically 3 years with a grace of 6 months.\nThe problem was that the realtors missed the delivery timeline and stopped paying EMIs. Delays ran into years, and banks raised EMI demands to buyers, which included penalties on defaults. So what seemed like an easy way to buy a house became a nightmare\nIn 2015, when a subvention scheme was implemented under Amrapali's Adarsh Awas Yojna with a payment structure of 10%-80%-10%, Rakesh Bhatia decided to invest. Under this arrangement, homebuyers were required to pay 10% of the amount initially, while 80% was financed by the bank, and the remaining 10% had to be paid separately.\nThe project primarily attracted govt employees, and Bhatia, a supervisor in the ministry of communication, was among them. He secured a home loan of Rs 35 lakh. At the time of booking, he paid Rs 4 lakh, while the bank disbursed the first instalment of Rs 12 lakh.\nHowever, he later discovered that phases 4 and 5 of the project had not been approved by the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority.

It was only after 18 months that I learnt about it,\" Bhatia said.\nHe had booked a 3BHK flat and, under the subvention scheme, paid an additional Rs 330 per square foot. The builder was supposed to bear the pre-EMI interest till possession was handed over. The project had a completion timeline of three years. \"The builder paid for eight or nine months and then stopped. After that, the case went to Supreme Court,\" he said.\nThere were 1,100 homebuyers in phases 4 and 5, 80% of whom had opted for the subvention scheme. \"It is shocking that the bank released funds for a project that had no approval.

This could not have happened without collusion between the bank and the builder,\" Bhatia said.\nWhile homebuyers lodged complaints at various forums, banks filed cases against them at the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT).

They collaborated with banks to offer interest-free loan options until possession, charging buyers a slightly higher price for the flats. Despite Reserve Bank of India prohibiting such innovative home loan schemes, subvention plans continued.\nAccording to TOI, subvention schemes were supposed to make things easier for buyers, but in many cases, became instruments that gave builders access to loans without accountability and left homebuyers in the city to bear the aftershocks, like demand letters to pay EMIs despite houses running years behind schedule.\nAlso read | How an easy home loan EMI scheme turned into a nightmare for many homebuyers in Delhi NCR\nHow does a subvention plan work?\nIt's an investment plan in which one buys a house but begins to pay EMI only after possession. Usually, a buyer needs to pay around 10% upfront. So, if it's a 1-crore house, upfront payment is 10 lakh.It differs as how is the house financed. The loan is taken by the realtor directly from the bank. The realtor pays a pre-EMI till the time of possession. But this EMI is only on the interest component. The buyer begins to pay EMI on the principal and the rest of the interest component after possession. The delivery timeline is typically 3 years with a grace of 6 months.\nThe problem was that the realtors missed the delivery timeline and stopped paying EMIs. Delays ran into years, and banks raised EMI demands to buyers, which included penalties on defaults. So what seemed like an easy way to buy a house became a nightmare\nIn 2015, when a subvention scheme was implemented under Amrapali's Adarsh Awas Yojna with a payment structure of 10%-80%-10%, Rakesh Bhatia decided to invest. Under this arrangement, homebuyers were required to pay 10% of the amount initially, while 80% was financed by the bank, and the remaining 10% had to be paid separately.\nThe project primarily attracted govt employees, and Bhatia, a supervisor in the ministry of communication, was among them. He secured a home loan of Rs 35 lakh. At the time of booking, he paid Rs 4 lakh, while the bank disbursed the first instalment of Rs 12 lakh.\nHowever, he later discovered that phases 4 and 5 of the project had not been approved by the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority. His flat was in phase 4. \"We had no idea about the approval status at the time of booking. It was only after 18 months that I learnt about it,\" Bhatia said.\nHe had booked a 3BHK flat and, under the subvention scheme, paid an additional Rs 330 per square foot.

He warned that the market might not be fully factoring in the potential risks, making it prudent for investors to maintain some liquidity.\n\"Our sense is that some amount of cash is not a bad idea at current levels because what we are still not factoring in is the global policy paralysis,\" Pandey explained. He further highlighted that historical market trends indicate an average correction of 27% in midcap and Nifty stocks, lasting for about seven months, making it crucial for investors to brace for potential volatility.\nCash Buffer: A Safety Net for Investors\nRetail investors, particularly those with a lower risk appetite, can benefit from holding cash in times of uncertainty. Keeping liquidity handy provides flexibility to take advantage of market dips, allowing investors to enter quality stocks at attractive valuations.\nDespite a positive outlook for domestic markets, Pandey noted that global headwinds remain unpredictable, and investors should not ignore the risks. \"Some bit of volatility I will not rule out and which is why a bit of cash at current levels is not a bad idea,\" he reiterated.\nAlso read: This is what the top of the bull market looks like with a lag: Zerodha’s Nithin Kamath after winning entrepreneur award\nWhere to Look for Opportunities?\nFor investors looking to deploy capital selectively, Pandey pointed to banking and capital goods as promising sectors. The banking sector remains strong due to RBI’s liquidity support, making Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, and HDFC Bank attractive picks. He also highlighted NBFCs like Bajaj Finance and Shriram Finance as potential opportunities.\nIn the capital goods space, Pandey mentioned that stocks like ABB have corrected significantly and are now trading at attractive valuations compared to their historical trading range.\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

There is a significant opportunity for Bharat Electronics (BEL) to perform and outperform. This correction should be taken as an opportunity to accumulate this stock.\nSome of the markers seem to be reversing. Crude is on our side and now RBI also is pumping in a whole lot of liquidity in the system. Do you think that is enough to turn around the markets?\nSudip Bandyopadhyay: Well, it may not be enough in the long term, but the short-term market is very much excited. Also, you must remember that a lot of good things are happening in Europe. Their debt ceiling, which they had imposed on themselves, they are agreeing to breach that, so specifically Germany and incremental liquidity, incremental economic activity in Europe is good for countries like India.\nThe Dollar index is also coming down. Crude is already down. These are good indicators as far as India is concerned. But we have to be careful. FII selling has not yet abated probably and we have to keep a strong watch on that. Look, FIIs have been holding mostly IT and BFSI stocks. These were the two favourite sectors and the recovery is not that sharp in IT and BFSI yet. So, obviously, the selling by FIIs is probably still on in those two pockets. A lot of other segments have picked up quite a bit, but not IT and BFSI.\nThe consensus call on the Street and especially more so after the RBI's measures to inject liquidity in the system seems to be to buy banks, buy financials and stick with the larger cap ones to be on the safe side. Is that your thought as well?\nSudip Bandyopadhyay: Absolutely. I have been recommending that for quite some time and I will continue to mention that. Beyond the RBI liquidity injection and other positive developments, the banks were really attractively valued. Post this correction, some of the larger banks, particularly SBI, was looking very good and somebody willing to build a long-term portfolio, SBI was definitely a good buy and continues to remain such.\nApart from that, some of the down and out banks which took a hit because of multiple reasons, particularly asset quality issues on the microfinance book, the time is coming for having a look at them. IndusInd Bank is, for that matter, one bank which I will definitely recommend from a little aggressive investors point of view. We have seen the worst and things should improve from here on. So, it is a good time to start buying into IndusInd Bank as well.\nBack home what we are seeing is that the pharma stocks are inching up higher day by day. Some bit of strength is returning in this particular pack. Given the flip-flop on US tariffs, what we have seen coming into autos, do you believe that the correction and the concern in the pharma space in the Indian players is overdone now and maybe it is time to once again look back seriously into this sector?\nSudip Bandyopadhyay: I still believe that it is better to be a little cautious. The US is going through a phase where volatility is the name of the game. Every morning there are new things coming out and by the end of the day there are further new things getting added. So, amidst this volatility, it is a little difficult to take a call at least for the short to medium term on these pharma stocks which most of them have significant exposure to the US.\nYes, the cost of manufacturing, which is the alternative being proposed in the US is probably five-six times compared to the same in India. But things are not fully rational at this stage. There is a lot of irrationality in this decision-making at this stage. I like pharma and I believe that pharma is in a space where IT was 15-20 years back and the quantum leap in pharma is bound to happen. When it will happen, I do not know, but at this stage, if somebody has to pay pharma, I would definitely say, look at domestic focused pharma companies.\nI do like Mankind Pharma quite a bit and that can be looked at definitely. Their BSV acquisition was criticised, but it is a fantastic long-term strategy. I also like pharma companies like Piramal Pharma, which have significant manufacturing facilities in the US. So, if you have to be a little safe, still play pharma, go for domestic focused pharma companies and pharma companies having significant manufacturing facilities in the US.\nOn Thursday, the heavy lifting was done by Reliance Industries because we were discussing how brokerages are now coming up with a re-rating and spotting Reliance as a re-rating candidate. Do you believe that Reliance can outperform the benchmark indices in the next one year because in the past one year, it surely has underperformed significantly.\nSudip Bandyopadhyay: I think there are multiple triggers and the research reports you are referring to are talking about some of them. The biggest trigger is going to be the Jio platforms listing. The IPO is expected to happen sometime during the next fiscal and that will be a significant value unlocking event.\nAlso, the tariff hike, as far as the Jio platform is concerned, is expected. It may happen in this calendar year or it may get pushed back to the February, March of next calendar year, but it is going to happen and that will again have a positive impact. As far as retail is concerned, we have seen the worst. The footfalls are increasing. The coverage is increasing and going forward, even retail will start to do well. O2C has been a bit of a soft spot for quite some time, but there are expectations of O2C also performing and outperforming. So, overall, value unlocking will be the number one trigger and beyond that sheer performance improvement also will definitely help the counter and help the script.\nWhat happens to the entire PSE story and in particular defence? I know it is at a fraction of when you bought that stock but after the recent fall, do you think they will show the same kind of leadership as they did seven to eight months back?\nSudip Bandyopadhyay: Well, I do not think they will show the kind of leadership which we did see them demonstrating about seven-eight months back. I think that was a bit over the top and a bit irrational. The valuation was definitely out of sync with the fundamentals. Things have cooled down quite a bit, but even then they are not cheap even today. But I do like BEL, Bharat Electronics, quite a bit and I have been recommending a buy there.\nBEL is in defence electronics and it caters to Air Force, Army, Navy – all the three segments. They have gone into exports as well. It is a very well-managed company, strong balance sheet, and they are now moving out of defence electronics and into major other areas like metro travel, so the opportunity for this company to continue to perform and outperform is significant. This correction should be taken as an opportunity to accumulate this stock.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

A significant part of UPI transactions will be powered by credit, not direct bank transfers. Payments will increasingly be made using a credit product, earning rewards and other benefits,” Bansal said during a fireside chat at an event organised by consultancy firm Redseer in Bengaluru.\nHis remarks come at a time when India’s digital payments landscape is undergoing a transformation, with players like Rupay Credit on UPI seeing rapid adoption. According to Bansal, Rupay credit cards now account for 60% of all credit card spends in India, with 90% of those transactions happening on UPI.\nBansal's words come in just a few week after he resigned as the CEO of Navi and will continue in the capacity of Executive Chairman of the Navi Group.\nNavi’s entry into UPI was initially met with skepticism, given the dominance of PhonePe, Google Pay, and Paytm. However, Bansal’s firm quickly climbed to become the fourth-largest player in November of 2024.\nAlso Read: Sachin Bansal's Navi overtakes Cred to emerge as fourth largest UPI app\nNavi has also been expanding its lending business aggressively. With a loan book of Rs 11,000 crore, Bansal acknowledges the need for a balance between secured and unsecured lending as the company scales.\n\"If we are handling lakhs of crores in loans in the future, there's no way we can have 90% of our portfolio as unsecured it would be too risky. Over time, I see secured lending growing to 50% of our portfolio,\" he said.\nDespite Navi’s success in payments and lending, the company has faced regulatory challenges. Its attempt to secure a banking licence was rejected by the RBI, forcing it to recalibrate its strategy.\nAlso Read: Navi failed to keep its promises to RBI, forcing regulatory action\nHowever, Bansal believes that Navi is now well-positioned for growth, having weathered market cycles, navigated regulatory stress, and built strong risk management capabilities.\nWith profitability on the rise, Navi is now considering an IPO to fund its next phase of growth.\n\"We have ticked most of the boxes in the last six years.

But now, a wave of reverse migration is sweeping through Indiaâs startup ecosystem. Companies that once set up their legal headquarters overseas are moving back to India, a trend known as âreverse flippingâ.\nThe list includes big names like Razorpay, Udaan, Pine Labs, and Meesho, with some, like Zepto, having already completed the process. The shift isnât simple â firms have to secure multiple legal and regulatory approvals and make hefty tax payments. Yet, many are taking the leap, driven by the promise of better IPO prospects, streamlined compliance, and Indiaâs booming economy.\nNotwithstanding the current state of the secondary market, the Indian capital market has matured significantly for IPOs, offering an attractive alternative to global markets. According to Alok Bathija, Partner at Accel, a software company with $50-$60 million in revenue and stable growth can now list in India, whereas a similar listing in the US would require nearly $500 million in revenue. With Indian markets offering higher valuations and greater accessibility, more startups are seeing the advantage of returning home.\nRise Of Reverse FlippingBeyond IPO aspirations, shifting back also simplifies compliance, especially for startups in highly regulated sectors like fintech. Many of these companies generate the majority of their revenue in India and operate primarily within its financial system, making it logical for them to align with Indian laws. Amit Nawka, Partner at PwC, explains that fintech startups, as they grow larger and play a bigger role in Indiaâs financial landscape, naturally fit better within the local regulatory framework. âAs far as fintechs are concerned, as they get larger and contribute to Indiaâs financial system, it is appropriate for them to be headquartered here, and it also gives regulators a sense of comfort,â he said.\nThe trend is also being fuelled by the expansion of domestic funding options. Previously, Indian startups headquartered abroad had easier access to global investors, particularly US-based venture capital firms, which preferred to invest in companies domiciled within their jurisdiction. But that is no longer the case. According to Siddarth Pai, co-chair at the Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA), the rise of family offices and domestic venture capital funds has changed the game. âNot just the IPO-bound startups, but a whole host of other startups are looking to flip back to India, especially those in regulated areas. It becomes easier for a company to plan its expansion and get approvals for setting up new businesses if its parent company is regulated by RBI or Sebi,â he said. The abolition of the angel tax has further encouraged many startups to make the shift.\nImpact On Indian Startup EcosystemIndustry estimates suggest that more than 70 startups are currently in the process of reversing their domiciles, and at least 20 of them are major ecosystem players. However, around 500 Indian startups are still headquartered abroad, mostly in the US and Singapore. Among the most prominent companies to move back was PhonePe, which paid a stagger- ing Rs 8,000 crore in taxes to shift its registration from Singapore to India. Sameer Nigam, co-founder & CEO of PhonePe, emphasised that for a highly regulated company like theirs, being based in India was the most logical decision. âIndia is where we started, India is where we are focused, and India is where we will stay for decades,â he said.\nThe Indian govt has taken steps to reduce bureaucratic hurdles and speed up the process for startups looking to shift back. Previously, an overseas startup merging with its Indian arm required National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) clearance, a time-consuming procedure. Now, only govt and RBI approvals are needed, making the transition faster and more efficient. The rally in Indian tech stocks has also dispelled the longheld myth that startups must list on NASDAQ to achieve significant valuations. âIndia is one of the most robust IPO markets globally. In the last year alone, India had the highest number of IPOs globally, and second in value to the US,â said Varun Malhotra, Partner at Quona Capital. In 2024, India had 327 companies listing on the market, versus 183 in the US and 125 in Europe and 98 in China.\nThe Future of Indian StartupsFor startups like Razorpay, moving back to India was an obvious choice. The company is paying over $100 million in taxes to make the transition, but CEO and co-founder Harshil Mathur believes itâs worth it. âThe process of going public in India is much more streamlined today, making it a natural choice for startups like ours to grow and thrive in one of the worldâs most dynamic economies. For Razorpay, reverse flipping aligns us closer to our primary market. India understands what Razorpay does, and it just makes logical sense for us to list on the market where people know us,â Mathur said.\nWith India rapidly emerging as a global startup powerhouse, this trend is only expected to accelerate. Sunil Khaitan, head of the financing group at Goldman Sachs India, predicts the âtrend (will) accelerate in 2025, further positioning India as a key hub for entrepreneurial activity and leading to increased capital market access.â As regulatory reforms continue and the domestic investment ecosystem strengthens, the era of Indian startups incorporating overseas may soon be a thing of the past.", "text_len": 5592}

Additionally, a correction in crude oil prices, influenced by a slowdown in demand and further economic stimulus from China, ignited optimism in the energy and metals sectors. Gains were further supported by strength in heavyweight banking and consumption stocks driven by improved liquidity conditions.\"\nHrishikesh Yedve, AVP Technical and Derivatives Research at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd said, âThe domestic benchmark index, Nifty, opened with a gap up, maintained buying interest, and settled the day on a bullish note at 22,545. Technically, Nifty has crossed and sustained above the first bearish gap (22,450-22,514), forming a green candle, which indicates strength. The next major resistance is around 22,668-22,720, where the next bearish gap is placed, followed by the previous breakdown point at 22,800. Thus, 22,720 and 22,800 will act as stiff resistance for the index. On the downside, 22,240 will act as immediate support.

U.S. companies added just 77,000 jobs in February, a sharp drop from the 186,000 positions created in January and well below the 148,000 forecast by economists.

Based on an average exchange rate of 84.46 to the dollar, nominal GDP in the December quarter came at just above $ 1 trillion. While the rupee has depreciated significantly in the current quarter, with average exchange rates for January and February being 86.27 and 87.05 , there is likelihood that nominal GDP will stay above the trillion-dollar mark even in the March quarter.\nThe December quarter’s growth is in line with analyst expectations and also marks a sequential recovery from the 5.6% growth (revised from 5.4%) seen in the September quarter. India’s GDP expected to grow at 6.5% in 2024-25, the ongoing fiscal year. This is ten basis points – one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point – more than what the first advance estimates released in January said.\nOn their own, these numbers would make the latest GDP data pretty normal.\nHowever, it is revisions in historical data which have made them extraordinary. India’s GDP growth in 2023-24, according to the first revised estimates released along with the latest quarterly and annual numbers for 2024-25, is now 9.2% instead of the 8.2% which was reported earlier. The 2022-23 GDP growth number now stands at 7.6% instead of 7%. These revisions have two important implications.\nThe first is vis-à-vis the current quarter which will end in March 2025. For 2024-25 annual GDP growth to meet its 6.5% projection, March quarter GDP will have to grow at 7.6%, significantly higher than most projections.\nThe latest GDP numbers also mean that the Indian economy has lost 2.7 percentage points in terms of growth momentum between 2023-24 and 2024-25. Even form a supply side perspective, the slowdown is pretty sharp. Gross Value Added (GVA) – it is GDP less net indirect taxes – growth has fallen from 8.6% in 2023-24 to 6.4% in 2024-25. Given the fact that 2023-24 growth was not on account of some favourable statistical base effect – 2022-23 GDP and GVA growth numbers were a healthy 7.6% and 7.2% – it indicates a significant loss of growth momentum in the ongoing fiscal year.\nChief economic adviser (CEA) V Anantha Nageswaran said India remained “the fastest-growing major economy during October-December 2024” driven by domestic demand and exports. “On the strength of the domestic demand, on capital formation and output growth, we will be able to grow at 6.5%, but there are some risk factors,” he said, citing the US dollar’s strength and rising Japanese interest rates that could exacerbate capital outflows.\n“Despite the uncertain global outlook, India’s economic momentum is expected to sustain, driven by strong rural demand and a revival in urban consumption,” he added. The current year, 2024-25 has been a year of fiscal tightening amidst an already hawkish monetary policy. The fiscal deficit was brought down from 5.6% in 2023-24 to 4.8% in 2024-25 according to the revised estimates. RBI kept the policy rate unchanged at 6.5% between February 2023 and January 2025 before the February cut of 25 basis points, the first interest rate reduction in five years. The question analysts are asking is whether growth was collateral damage to the succesful effort to control inflation and consolidate fisc? To be sure, this is a question which can only be asked in hindsight. The other question is whether the latest numbers lead to a more dovish outlook by RBI in matters of monetary policy? A fiscal support is ruled out given the ongoing consolidation. This year’s budget has set a fiscal deficit target of 4.4% for 2025-26.\n“We expect the GDP growth at 6.5% next fiscal, supported by normal monsoons, lower food inflation and rate cuts of 75-100 basis points in the current cycle that began earlier this month. However, a lower fiscal impulse is expected to cap growth next year. The good news is growth is becoming more balanced as private consumption’s share in GDP rose in fiscal 2025. However, investment’s share has been moderating since fiscal 2024,” said Dharmakriti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil. “The complexity of risks from tariff actions – already initiated and likely to be followed by more such measures in the coming months – is evolving and creates a downside bias to our forecasts,” Joshi added.\nRevisions aside, what do the latest GDP numbers tells us?\nQuarterly GDP growth has shown some revival from the September quarter (now revised) number of 5.6% to 6.2% in the December quarter. The growth improvement is broad based and spread across sectors. From the demand side, investment has lost momentum while private and government consumption have gained pace. Part of this is understandable given the union budget missing its capital spending target. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE), Government Final Consumption Expenditure (GFCE) and Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) grew at 6.9%, 8.3% and 5.7% respectively in the quarter ending December 2024 compared to 5.9%, 3,8% and 5.8% in the quarter ending September 2024.\nIn the annual numbers, the slowdown between 2023-24 and 2024-25 is spread across all sectors except agriculture and Public Administration, Defence & Other Services. From the expenditure side, the slowdown is despite an increase in PFCE growth from 5.6% in 2023-23 to 7.6% in 2024-25 and a result of GFCE and GFCF losing growth momentum. GFCE growth is expected to decline from 8.1% in 2023-24 to 3.8% in 2024-25. GFCF growth numbers for 2023-24 and 2024-25 are 8.8% and 6.1%.", "text_len": 6180}

According to blockchain analytics company Chainalysis, the country maintained its top ranking in crypto adoption for the second consecutive year in 2024. A young, digitally savvy population with widespread smartphone access has played a significant role in driving this trend.\nThe rise of crypto from the fringes to the mainstream is deeply intertwined with Indiaâs digital transformation, ushering in a new era of investment sentiment fuelled by a strong push for portfolio diversification. CoinDCX, one of Indiaâs largest crypto exchanges, has been instrumental in this shift, bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and everyday accessibility.\nFounded by IIT Bombay alumni Sumit Gupta and Neeraj Khandelwal, CoinDCX has not only weathered the challenges of Indiaâs evolving crypto landscape but has also helped shape it. In this email interview, the founders reflect on their entrepreneurial journey, the hurdles of launching a crypto exchange in India, and how CoinDCX stands apart through its focus on security, compliance, and innovation. They also share their vision for Web3, the expansion of decentralised finance (DeFi) through Okto, and what lies ahead for crypto investors.\nEconomicTimes.com: Can you share a bit about your backgrounds and what inspired you to enter the crypto space?\nSumit: My journey began in the small, quiet village of Rahi in Madhya Pradesh. I studied at a local Hindi-medium school until the 5th grade, and despite limited resources, my parents prioritised my education. It was in class 10 that I first heard about IIT, and I made it my goal to study there. After achieving that dream and graduating from IIT Bombay, I was recruited by Sony via campus placement, which took me to Japan. However, my passion for contributing to Indiaâs growth brought me back, which continues to drive me today.\nNeeraj: I grew up in a village near Jaipur, Rajasthan, and after completing my schooling, I joined IIT Bombay for higher education. My father ran a utensil shop, and growing up around his business, I learned early on about entrepreneurship and the importance of ethics and hard work. After college, I joined the family business to understand the real-world challenges of entrepreneurship. This experience laid the foundation for my work with startups, where I focused on technical architecture and further developed my entrepreneurial skills.\nEconomicTimes.com: How did you two meet?\nSumit: Itâs an interesting story. We first crossed paths in Kota while preparing for the IIT entrance examinations. I was searching for shared rental accommodation when I saw a sublet notice. Thatâs how I met Neeraj, and by coincidence, we both ended up at IIT Bombay, spending the next four years together.\nEconomicTimes.com: What was the turning point that led you to start CoinDCX, and how did your early experiences shape your vision for the company?\nNeeraj: Our story is similar to that of many successful tech and finance startups. We started small and now have grown into one of the largest crypto exchanges in India. At IIT Bombay, we were exposed to cutting-edge technologies, which ignited our passion for blockchain. We recognised its potential to reshape industries and empower individuals globally but saw that in India, the technology was largely complex, inaccessible, and misunderstood. This gap motivated us to establish CoinDCX in 2018, driven by a vision of making crypto more accessible, secure, and easy to use for the masses.\nSumit: ne of our biggest achievements has been simplifying crypto investing for Indians. This has helped us onboard over 1.5 crore Indian users on our platform. The CoinDCX app is a one-stop shop for everything crypto, including advanced trading tools, Crypto SIPs for regular investing, and even options for earning passive income. We continue to innovate and build new features to make the experience even better.\nEconomicTimes.com: What were the biggest obstacles you faced when launching CoinDCX in 2018, and how did you overcome them?\nSumit: When we launched CoinDCX, we were confident in the potential of blockchain technology, but crypto was still a largely unknown concept in India until 2016. There was widespread scepticism, and awareness was low. Neeraj and I knew we were embarking on an unconventional journey, starting with limited resources from Neerajâs flat in Mumbai.\nJust before our launch, we faced a major obstacleâthe Reserve Bank of India imposed a banking ban on crypto, which led investors to pull back, making it difficult for us to secure funding. Despite these challenges, we stayed committed to our vision, focusing on solid product development. We persevered through the tough times and when the ban was lifted in 2020, investors came back, and we were ready to scale. In 2021, CoinDCX became Indiaâs first crypto unicorn.\nWeâve been focused on educating people about responsible crypto investing.

Crypto Karo, reaching over 50 lakh people, spreads awareness and promotes responsible practices in crypto.\nEconomicTimes.com: When CoinDCX started, there were other exchanges in the market. What did CoinDCX do differently to stand out?\nSumit: From day one, our primary focus has been on providing the highest level of security and trust to our users. We understand that for any trader, the foremost concern is the safety of their funds, and to build this trust factor, we prioritised security, transparency, and compliance. CoinDCX was the first crypto exchange in India to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND), ensuring we adhered to regulatory standards. Additionally, we obtained ISO certification, a clear demonstration of our commitment to maintaining the highest quality standards.\nFurthermore, our Proof of Reserves (PoR) and liabilities transparency initiatives have set us apart. These steps have not only helped us earn the confidence of our users but have also solidified CoinDCX as a responsible and compliant entity in the crypto space.\nNeeraj Khandelwal: While our exchange remains Indiaâs largest, where investors can trade safely and in a compliant manner, Web3 presents opportunities beyond a centralised exchange. We are on a mission to bring Web3 to the masses.\nIn order to provide greater investment opportunities, especially in the DeFi space, we introduced Okto, a self-custodial wallet. Okto empowers users to trade more than 50,000 tokens across various DeFi chains such as Ethereum, Base, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Arbitrum. To further simplify the Web3 experience, weâre rolling out Okto Chain, which will help developers integrate Web3 features into any app seamlessly. This will significantly improve user experience, making Web3 more accessible. With Okto Chain, Web3 is much closer to becoming mainstream.\nEconomicTimes.com: What is the scale and size of your company and who are your investors?\nSumit: CoinDCX has grown significantly since its inception. Today, we are a team of over 500 employees, with offices across key cities in India, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Delhi. We have also expanded our presence internationally, with a strategic acquisition of BitOasis in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, further cementing our global footprint.\nOur vision and the potential we see in the crypto space have attracted some of the most respected investors worldwide, including Pantera Capital, Steadview Capital, Bain Capital Ventures, and Coinbase Ventures.

Last year, we acquired BitOasis, one of the pioneering crypto platforms of the MENA region. We want to be present in more such crypto-friendly countries.\nNeeraj: Our vision is to create a global impact and shift the narrative about Indiaâs tech capabilitiesâthat India can build technology and products that can match any global level.

In 2024, foreign investors pulled out over ₹16,000 crore from the sector.\n\"The tariffs being imposed by the US are likely to affect the auto sector, making it difficult to maintain exports and in addition, the valuations in the sector had also run up last year,\" said U R Bhat, co-founder, Alphaniti. \"This is likely to have driven the foreign selling in the sector.\"\nHealthcare and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sectors saw outflows of ₹2,996 crore and ₹2,568 crore, respectively. While they purchased shares worth ₹1,534 crore in the healthcare sector in the first 15 days of the month, they sold shares worth over ₹4,000 crore in the FMCG sector.\nBhat said that since healthcare also has a significant exposure to the US, the tariffs have dampened foreign sentiment on this segment as well.\n\"The demand has not picked up in the FMCG sector as anticipated and the expensive valuations are expected to have led to outflows,\" said Bhat.\nFinancial services faced the maximum brunt of foreign selling this year, but witnessed some respite as the pace of selling came down in the second-half of February.\nOverseas investors offloaded shares worth Rs 1,647 crore after divesting Rs 24,949 crore worth shares in the sector in January.\n“Most large private banks and NBFCs have performed well, led by recent measures taken by the RBI to improve liquidity,” said Saurabh Patwa, portfolio manager and head of research, Quest Investment.\nThe worst of the asset quality issues in personal credit is nearing to bottom out which is also supportive for the sector, he said.\nForeign investors sold shares worth Rs 1,820 crore in the construction materials sector and withdrew over Rs 1,200 crore from capital goods, consumer durables and power sector in the second half of the month.\nOverseas investors pumped Rs 7,261 crore across five sectors, with the telecommunication sector witnessing the highest inflows worth Rs 5,661 crore after they bought shares worth Rs 2,337 crore in the first half of the month. Promoter Group Indian Continent Investment Limited sold shares of Bharti Airtel worth Rs 8,485 crore in a block deal on February 18.\nAnalysts said that the change in shareholding in telecom major, Bharti Airtel has led to the infusion of foreign funds in the sector in the second half of the month. Global investors purchased shares worth Rs 1,362 crore and Rs 112 crore respectively in sectors earmarked as ‘Others’ and Information Technology (IT).\n“In the next one month or so, easing of the US dollar and some finality in terms of Trump’s trade tariffs, as also a potential peace deal, could spark a risk-on sentiment on emerging markets among overseas investors,” said Bhat.\nThese factors are likely to stabilise over the next month or so and some inflows in India can be anticipated as it is relatively better placed, he said. “It is difficult to ascertain the near-term direction of foreign flows despite valuations turning fairly attractive in some sectors given the uncertainty at macro level creating volatility at currency level as well as crude impacting several businesses in the near term”, said Patwa.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

However, those old borrowers who have their floating rate loans still linked to MCLR regime has now got the option to shift to EBLR regime whenever they wish.\nRead below to know what are the new PNB EBLR and MCLR rates\nPNB EBLR rate as of March 1, 2025\nAccording to PNB website the EBLR rate for two benchmarks- Treasury bills (T-Bills) and Repo linked rate both has been revised with effect from March 1, 2025Hereâs a table showing the revised T-bill linked lending rates (TBLLR)\nPNB Prime Plus rate based on 3 Month T-Bill rate 6.5%\nTenor Premium\n| 6 Month | 0.1% |\n| 12 Month | 0.1% |\nPNB Repo Linked Lending Rate-RLLR\nTenor premium\n| â¥1yr undefined3yr | 0.00% |\n| â¥3yr undefined5yr | 0.6% |\n| â¥5yr undefined10yr | 1% |\n| â¥10yr & â¤15yr | 1.5% |\nSource: PNB website\nPunjab National Bank\nPNB MCLR rate as of March 1, 2025\nAccording to the PNB website, here's a table showing the new MCLR rates which have been increased by 0.05% across all tenors.\nMCLR Tenor Old rate (February 1, 2025) New rate (March 1, 2025)\n| MCLR Tenor | Old rate (February 1, 2025) | New rate (March 1, 2025) |\n| Overnight | 8.35% | 8.4% |\n| One month | 8.45% | 8.5% |\n| Three month | 8.65% | 8.7% |\n| Six month | 8.85% | 8.9% |\n| One year | 9% | 9.05% |\n| Three years | 9.3% | 9.35% |\nHow is MCLR calculated?\nAccording to Axis Bank website as of March 1, 2025, Banks calculate the MCLR based on the tenure of the loan. However, MCLR is internal to the bank. The actual lending rate includes the spread over and above the MCLR. MCLR is calculated by taking into account these components:- Marginal cost of funds: The cost of funds are important in determining the MCLR in banking. It is the average rate at which the deposits with similar maturities were raised during a specific period. Basically, it involves the cost at which banks obtain funds for lending.\n- Negative carry on cash reserve ratio (CRR): Banks are required to maintain a certain portion of cash reserves with the RBI on which they do not earn any interest. The cost associated with this non-earning reserve is considered as negative CRR.\n- Operating costs: Third factor is the operational costs incurred by the bank. This normally includes administrative costs, office expenses, employees salaries, rental expenses, utility, etc.\n- Tenure premium: The longer the tenure, the higher the risk of loan. Therefore, the bank charges a premium to cover this risk, known as tenure premium. It is determined based on the average maturity of the bank liabilities.", "text_len": 2829}

It is known for maintaining its excellent asset quality even during financial stress.\nAlthough the bank has presence in many other business areas, including broking, life insurance, and asset management, the standalone banking entity contributes the most to its profit, 85%.\nNotably, the bank’s performance has not been up to the mark on Dalal Street, with its share price delivering just a 19% return in the last five years, against the Nifty Bank’s return of 68%, despite robust performance.\nKMB underperformed bank nifty significantly\nOne reason for this vast underperformance is the KMB valuation running ahead of time. RBI’s ban on issuing credit cards and adding new customers digitally also impacted its business, which has now been lifted. However, this is a thing of the past now.\nNow, the important question is where Kotak Bank stands as an independent entity in terms of its financial position and valuation. Let’s have a look.\nStrong loan book focused on consumer credit\nKMB has a strong advance book, which has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% in the last five years to ₹4.3 trillion in FY24.\nThe book grew by 20% over last year, led by strong overall performance. Strong 20% growth in secured consumer books, 20% in commercial books, 21% in corporate banking, and 18% in SME books drove this strong performance.\nKMB Advances’ book is highly diversified. 45% of the book comes from consumer loans, followed by commercial, corporate banking, SME, etc.\nBank contributes 85% to the consolidated entity\nFurthermore, 77% of the book is secured loans, while the rest is unsecured. Notably, unsecured retail advances, which are under stress with rising defaults, constitute 11.8% of net advances, increasing just 1.8% from FY23.\nKMB’s proactive approach to identifying risks in this sector and curbing loan growth when the segment showed signs of stress is commendable. This foresightedness speaks volumes for KMB’s pristine asset quality in the banking sector.\nThe bank expects advance growth to continue at the current rate, especially since India is still a credit-starved economy. Kotak has also acquired Standard Chartered Bank’s personal loan portfolio worth ₹41 billion to fortify its position in the retail credit market.\nHowever, this book is too small—just 1% of Kotak advances—not enough to move the needle for it. Nevertheless, Kotak does get about 95,000 affluent customers to whom it can cross-sell products.\nMoreover, the RBI has also lifted the ban imposed on KMB this quarter, which will help it grow personal loans and credit cards starting going forward, though at a slower pace due to stress in unsecured loans.\nEY estimates that the mortgage market in India will double from $300 billion to $600 billion over the next five years as income levels rise, affordability improves and fiscal support is provided.\nDespite this, mortgage penetration will remain at 13% of GDP, significantly lower than in China (18%) and the US (52%). KMB, being a premier bank, is expected to be a big beneficiary of this rising credit demand in coming years.\nSteady deposit growth despite CASA ratio decline\nKMB deposits have grown at a CAGR of 14% during the last five years to ₹4.5 trillion in FY24, up 24% from the previous year. This growth was commendable as the banking sector deposits grew marginally at around 13%, per CareEdge Ratings.\nHowever, like the banking sector, Kotak struggled to attract low-cost current and savings account (CASA) deposits, which stood at ₹2.04 trillion.\nKMB CASA deposits have grown at a CAGR of 8% over the last five years; however, the pace of SA growth has recently been challenging for the bank.\nNotably, Kotak’s CASA ratio has been on a downward trajectory, after hitting a peak of 60.4% in FY21. This has declined to 45.5% in FY24.\nA high CASA ratio helps banks lower their cost of funds and enables the engine to grow the asset book. As Kotak’s CASA deposits declined, the cost of funds to attract deposits has increased.\nThus, it is chasing the salary segment, where deposit rates are stable. Besides, the bank is looking to increase cross-selling to existing customers, as this will lower the marginal cost of acquisition and also help improve SA balances.\nKMB CASA ratio declining, but term deposit grew strongly\nAs the bank struggled to attract deposits, it offered higher rates, increasing the cost of savings accounts by 0.29% to 4.13%. The bank also attracted deposits by offering higher rates on term deposits (TD).\nKotak term deposits stood at Rs 2.2 trillion in Q4FY24, growing 35% year-on-year (YoY). This growth was driven by the Kotak ActiveMoney TD sweep facility (offering a lower rate than term deposits but higher than savings accounts), which grew massively by 102% to ₹470 billion.\nThe sweep-in facility enables customers to link their existing fixed deposits with a current or savings account, thereby helping them earn higher rates on deposits swept from savings accounts.\nAlthough deposit growth has slowed down due to the slowdown in the Indian economy, there are signs of improvement. According to Anand Rathi Research, deposit growth rose to 10.3% in January after a decline in December. This was led by a surge in time and demand deposits.\nMoreover, following the recent stock market correction, retail investors are expected to park their savings in banks, which will help KMB recover low-cost CASA.\nKMB net interest income and margins\nKMB’s net interest income (NII) has grown at a CAGR of 18% to ₹337 billion during FY20-24, driven by strong loan book expansion, an improved net interest margin (NIM), and a higher share of retail loans.\nNotably, the bank’s NIM reduced by 0.1% to 5.31% due to higher funding costs, a shift in the loan mix toward lower-yielding segments, such as secured retail loans, and a slowdown in unsecured lending.\nHowever, RBI cutting interest rates may reduce KMB NIM. Usually, banks pass on the benefits of rate cuts to borrowers more quickly than to depositors. In such a case, the bank will first pass on the benefits of lower rates to borrowers.\nHowever, deposit rates are already low, and the bank will find it challenging to reduce them due to the slowdown in deposit growth.\nThis is expected to minimise NIM in the future. However, to support margins, the bank has reduced rates by 0.5% in select SA buckets, which is expected to reduce its cost.\nPristine asset quality\nThe bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPA) stood at 1.39%, while its net NPA was 0.34%. This was lower than 1.78% and 0.37% in FY23, reflecting improved asset quality.\nAs a result, credit costs—provisions made for potential loan defaults—moderated to 0.45%, supported by loan recoveries, stable slippage and controlled provisioning.\nThe bank took a proactive stance and wrote off unsecured retail loans worth Rs 14.5 billion, which it extended in the fourth quarter.\nMoreover, the bank’s provision coverage ratio stood at 75.9%, down 3.4% from the previous year. It raised its provision coverage to deal with rising stress in unsecured loans, which is not isolated to KMB but has been an industry-wide phenomenon.\nExcellent asset quality with healthy provision coverage ratio\nLooking ahead, the Bank is expected to be prudent in its underwriting approach, ensuring quality without compromising on standards.\nFurther, the Bank’s default rates in unsecured loans are favourable, with low credit costs. Thus, the bank is confident in its risk management stance concerning unsecured loans.\nIt aims to grow its unsecured lending book with mid-teen growth, ensuring full provision for anything overdue beyond 180 days. Bank credit costs – provisions that banks set aside for potential loan defaults – doubled to 0.4% from 0.17% in FY23.\nThe management noted reduced stress in personal loans, while stress in the MFI business increased, with signs of stress rising in the CV segment. Thus, KMB’s credit cost is expected to be higher in FY26, which will ease as the stress moderates.\nRobust financials and resilient return ratios\nThe bank’s net profit has grown at a strong 21% CAGR in the last 5 years to ₹182 billion in FY24, driven by healthy loan book expansion, strong growth in NII post, stable asset quality, and improving operating efficiencies.\nKMB’s profit grew 26% over the past year. This was supported by a lower cost-to-income ratio – which compares operating expenses to total income – which fell to 45.9% from 48.2% in FY23.\nThis reflects KMB’s ability to generate higher revenue than its costs. Consequently, the bank’s return on equity (RoE) also increased to 15.3%, up from 14% last year.\nStrong profit growth with a robust capital base\nMoreover, KMB’s Capital Adequacy Ratio stands at a strong 20.5%, improving from 17.9% in FY20. On the other hand, its common equity tier 1 (CET 1) – the highest quality capital – ratio stood at 19.2%, better than 17.1% in FY20.\nThis strong ratio reflects the bank’s robust capital position, ensuring its ability to absorb risks and maintain financial stability. Moreover, the company expects the CAR/Tier-1 ratios to stabilise at around 22 levels.\nReturn on assets (ROA) measures how efficiently a bank generates profit from assets, including loans and investments. It stood at 2.61%, up 0.14% from last year, which shows the bank’s strong ability to generate returns.\nIs KMB’s valuation finally looking reasonable\nKMB’s valuation has moderated to a price-to-book (PB) ratio of 2.9, 36% lower than 10-year median PB of 4.5.\nRelatively, it is trading at par with HDFC Bank, which has a PB of 2.9, and at a nearly 10% discount to ICICI Bank, which has a PB of 3.3.\nHowever, ICICI’s performance has been more robust, leading to its valuation rerating. KMB has underperformed not because its performance has been subdued but because its valuation ran ahead of its time.\nNevertheless, its current valuation is still on par with that of the Nifty Private Bank Index, which means that while lower than the median, it’s still not very cheap compared to its peers.\nKMB valuation on-par with nifty private bank index\nHDFC Securities has set a target price of ₹2,040 at 2.2x Sep-26 adjusted book value per share, which is just 5% upside from the current market price of ₹1,940, factoring in higher credit costs.\nDisclaimer\nNote: We have relied on data from www.Screener.in throughout this article.

Has it corrected to the right level in terms of value? That is the question to ask,\" he asserted.\nIn an interaction with ETNow, he cautioned against assuming that every decline presents a buying opportunity and urged investors to focus on true valuation rather than price movements alone.\nHere is what he said:\n\"The market seems to be more focused on prices rather than looking at the price-value proposition across stocks,\" Prasad said. He noted that consumer staple stocks, despite declining growth rates, continue to trade at 45-60 times forward price-to-earnings (PE) multiples.\nPreviously, these companies achieved high single-digit volume growth and low double-digit revenue growth, but now they are struggling with low single-digit volume growth. Despite this slowdown, their high valuations remain largely intact.\n\"What is the rationale of giving similar higher multiples for companies which are growing much slower in the next one or two years?\" he questioned, stressing that the presence of rising competition and business model disruptions further weakens the case for such premium pricing.\nBanking: A sector offering value amid market uncertainty\nWhile many sectors lack compelling valuations, Prasad sees value in the banking space, particularly in large-cap banks that have remained resilient despite market corrections.\n\"It is one of the few sectors where there is value,\" he remarked, acknowledging short-term challenges such as high non-performing loans (NPLs) in microfinance institution (MFI) loan books and unsecured personal credit loans. However, he believes these issues are temporary and should stabilize over the next few quarters.\nAmong large banks, ICICI Bank stands out for its strong fundamentals, stable NPLs, and healthy credit and deposit growth. Prasad noted that even if ICICI Bank does not see any further re-rating, investors can still expect a 15-16% return per annum based on its return on assets (ROA) growth.\nHe also pointed to HDFC Bank, which is currently facing a liability-asset mismatch that could restrict growth in the short term. However, by FY27, the bank is expected to regain its growth momentum, potentially leading to a valuation re-rating.\nFor investors with a higher risk appetite, beaten-down names like Bandhan Bank and IndusInd Bank could offer opportunities. These banks, which have significant exposure to MFI loans, have already corrected to one times price-to-book (P/B), suggesting that much of the bad news is priced in.\nPrasad also highlighted that RBI’s increased focus on growth and improving banking liquidity will be key catalysts for the sector, allowing banks to take on more risk and expand credit growth.\nNarrative stocks: Even a 60% correction may not be enough\nPrasad issued a strong warning against \"narrative stocks\"—companies that surged without strong fundamentals but have since seen major corrections. Despite declines of 30%, 50%, or even 60%, he believes many of these stocks remain highly overvalued.\n\"These stocks need to correct a lot more. The fair values of these companies are significantly lower than where the current prices are,\" he stated, adding that some stocks are still trading at 8-10 times price-to-book (P/B) ratios despite generating no profits or having unsustainable business models.\nReferencing his \"Dead Cat Bounce\" report, Prasad explained the risks of investing in such speculative stocks. \"Look at from a PE basis, there are some companies which are trading at 70-80 PE and these are not companies which are growing at some very ridiculous growth rates that you can justify that kind of PE,\" he observed.\nWhile acknowledging that certain stocks had risen on liquidity-driven rallies, he maintained that their current corrections do not necessarily mean they have reached fair value.\nAlso read: Jim Walker saw the 2008 stock market crash coming.

However, this is the second time that the RBI has approved a shorter tenure than what was proposed by the board. In March 2023, the RBI had approved a two-year term for Kathpalia instead of the three years initially recommended by the bank's board. This decision does not align with the RBI's typical practice of approving a three-year tenure for bank chiefs.\n\"Further to our letter dated September 27, 2024, we hereby inform that the Reserve Bank of India has conveyed its approval for re-appointment of Sumant Kathpalia as managing director & CEO of the bank for a further period of one year with effect from March 24, 2025 till March 23, 2026,\" the exchange filing stated.\nKathpalia was first appointed as the CEO of IndusInd Bank in 2020. During his tenure, the bank has faced challenges, particularly with increased stress in its microfinance portfolio. In the December quarter, the lender reported slippages of ₹2,200 crore, with ₹695 crore of that amount coming from the microfinance book.\nKathpalia had addressed the situation by indicating that the incremental stress in the microfinance segment might be nearing its peak. He noted that the higher slippages in this segment were partly due to the broader challenges facing the microfinance industry at large. This suggests that while the bank has been facing some difficulties in this area, there may be a reduction in future stress as the situation stabilises. In his five-year stint with the private lender, IndusInd Bank has seen its stock price more than doubling from ₹398 per share to close to ₹936 apiece at the end of day's trade Friday.\nKathpalia is a career banker with over 37 years of rich experience in large multinational banks such as Citibank, Bank of America and ABN AMRO prior to joining Indusind Bank. At IndusInd Bank, Kathpalia has been part of the core leadership team and joined the bank 17 years ago and has been pivotal in turning the bank around.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

Growth in other personal loans, which include unsecured loans, declined to 9% in January 2025 from 23% in January 2024, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data. However, consumer durable loans saw a slight 2% year-on-year decline in January 2025, while credit card spending growth eased to 13% from 31% over the same period.\n“Slowdown in retail credit reflects the impact of hardening of interest rates and increase of risk weights on unsecured loans. Over the past year, interest rates on retail loans -including home, vehicle, and personal loans- have risen significantly, deterring potential borrowers from seeking new credit,” said the head of retail credit of the private bank. “Banks have adopted a more cautious approach to unsecured loans in response to concerns raised by the Reserve Bank of India regarding personal loans”.\nRBI former governor Shaktikanta Das had expressed concerns about unbridled growth in personal loans and advised lenders to go slow on unsecured loans. The banking sector regulator decided to increase risk weights on unsecured loans in November 2023 and directed banks and non-banking financial companies to reserve more capital for risk weights. The mandatory risk weight requirement was increased by 25 percentage points and is applicable to unsecured personal loans, credit cards and lending to NBFCs.\nThe RBI on February 25 this year, announced to reduce risk weights on bank loans to NBFCs and microfinance loans to 100% from 125 % earlier. However, it has retained the risk weights for unsecured loans at the same level. An increase in risk weights makes it more expensive for banks to lend as they are required to set aside more capital for such loans.\n“We expect personal loan growth to rebound in the next financial year. The new RBI governor has stated that no moderation in personal loans is required, which should offer banks some reassurance,” said a senior official from a public sector bank. “Banks are now waiting for the reduction in risk weights for unsecured loans. Hopes are high after RBI reduced risk weights for NBFC loans”.\nApart from personal loans, significant moderation is also visible in home, vehicle and education loans. Home loans growth declined 11% to `29.5 lakh crore as on January end this year compared to 37% growth seen in January 2024. Similarly, vehicle loans growth declined 10% to `6.2 lakh crore as on January end this year compared to 16% growth seen in January 2024.\nGold loans have bucked the trend by registering strong growth. Loan against jewellery surged 77% to `1.8 lakh crore as of January end compared to 17% in the same month last year. Growth in loan against gold jewellery has maintained a strong momentum due to an increase in prices of gold.", "text_len": 2887}

The board had approved a three-year extension for Kathpalia.\nTherefore, following the end of his tenure, if a PSU banker is appointed at the helm of the bank, CLSA noted that it might lead to further negative sentiment.\nGiven the rapid fall in IndusInd Bank's share price, if lenders invoke the promoter's stock pledge, it would add uncertainty to the stock. However, over time, CLSA believes that the bank's fundamentals will take over.\nThere are two fundamental positives for the bank in the near time. The first, is a recovery in the beleaguered microfinance sector. The second is the respite for banking margins from better banking system liquidity and the RBI's monetary policy easing cycle.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It was the major loser in the Nifty 50. Investors have been selling the stock for the past five trading sessions without a break, falling almost 8%. Here are 4 reasons why it declined:\nLong-term worries: RBI reappoints Kathpalia as CEO for 1 year\nThe Reserve Bank of India approved the re-appointment of Sumant Kathpalia as the Managing Director & CEO of the private lender for a period of one year. The bank has submitted the application for the approval of 3 years. “We hereby inform that the Reserve Bank of India vide its letter dated March 6, 2025 has conveyed its approval for re-appointment of Mr. Sumant Kathpalia as Managing Director & CEO of the Bank for a further period of one year with effect from March 24, 2025 till March 23, 2026,” read an exchange filing.\nNuvama on IndusInd Bank: Stock to remain under pressure\nNuvama Institutional Equities expects the banking stock to “remain under pressure” given low visibility, expectations of a soft Q4 FY25 and uncertainty on top management. The brokerage firm expects the bank will likely use the one year to transition to a new CEO. Given the RBI’s preference for an external CEO in case of recent appointments, the odds of an external CEO at IndusInd Bank after Kathpalia are high. “Should this happen, near-term earnings visibility—already impacted by a weak MFI cycle—will become lower,” said Nuvama.\nMoital Oswal on IndusInd Bank: Cuts earnings estimate\nMotilal Oswal has cut the earnings estimates by 9% for FY26 and 10% for FY27 as a result of the second instance when the MD’s term extension has been shorter than the board’s proposal. Meanwhile they maintained the ‘Buy’ rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1,100. The reason behind this move is that the brokerage house thinks that at the current valuations, the bank is already pricing in most of these uncertainties. “We find the current valuations inexpensive, particularly as operating performance starts to recover in FY26,” the report stated.\nIndusInd Bank: Poor performance in previous quarters\nThe company’s net profit has been declining over the past four quarters. There has been a downturn in the profitability of the bank. Its net profit has declined from Rs 2,347 crore level in Q4 FY24 to Rs 1,401 crore in Q3 FY25, with Q3FY25 net profit down 39% YoY.

The steep drop came after the bank disclosed discrepancies in its derivatives accounting, sparking concerns among investors and analysts. This marks the steepest fall in IndusInd Bank’s stock since March 2020.\nWith analysts warning of a possible earnings hit and raising concerns about weak internal controls, the stock has taken a severe beating. But what exactly happened, and what does it mean for IndusInd Bank and its investors? ET explains the whole discrepancy saga of IndusInd Bank shares in 5Ws and 1H.\nWhat happened?\nIndusInd Bank reported accounting discrepancies in its derivatives portfolio, leading to a 20% crash in its stock price. An internal review found that the bank had underestimated hedging costs related to past forex transactions. This revelation has forced the bank to acknowledge a potential impact of Rs 1,600-2,000 crore on its net worth, equivalent to 2.35 per cent as of December 2024.\nFollowing this, investors reacted sharply, causing the bank’s shares to hit their lowest level since November 2020. Analysts have also raised concerns about weak internal controls and governance issues within the bank.\nAlso Read: IndusInd Bank shares hit by downgrades, target price cuts. What investors should do\nWho is affected?\nThe biggest impact is on IndusInd Bank and its investors. The bank's stock has already lost 42% over the past year. Analysts believe that the findings raise concerns about the bank’s internal controls and compliance measures.\nWhen did this issue emerge?\nThe discrepancies were identified between September and October 2024, following the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) updated master directions on derivatives. The bank disclosed the issue in its exchange filing on March 10, Monday, after a board meeting.\nFurther, the stock reacted on Monday, too, ending nearly 4 per cent lower after the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to extend the incumbent CEO's term by just one year against three years that was sought by India's fifth largest private lender.\nAlso Read: Indian stocks look attractive, valuations cheapest since Covid: Morgan Stanley\nWhere is the impact visible?\nApart from IndusInd Bank’s stock crash, the Indian banking sector also faced minor setbacks. The Nifty Bank index fell 0.7%, while the broader Nifty 50 declined by 0.27%. The issue could also affect investor confidence in banking stocks, particularly regarding risk management practices.\nWhy did IndusInd Bank face this issue?\nThe discrepancies stem from past forex transactions where the bank underestimated hedging costs. This led to an incorrect valuation in its accounts. The issue is linked to compliance with RBI's new guidelines on derivatives portfolio management.\nHow is IndusInd Bank responding?\nThe bank has launched a detailed internal review and appointed an external agency to validate its findings. It has assured investors that its profitability and capital adequacy remain strong enough to absorb the one-time impact. The loss will be accounted for in either Q4 FY25 or Q1 FY26.\nWhat’s next?\nAnalysts warn that the stock may face further de-rating due to concerns over weak internal controls. Emkay Global has downgraded IndusInd Bank to 'Add' from 'Buy' and slashed its target price by 22% to Rs 875. Meanwhile, Nuvama downgraded IndusInd Bank to 'Reduce' from 'Hold' and cut its target price to Rs 750. Motilal Oswal downgraded IndusInd Bank to ‘Neutral’ with a revised target price of Rs 925, down from an earlier estimate.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 3944}

The interested parties should apply through the PRAVAAH portal before June 15, the RBI said in an announcement on March 12.\n“The AA ecosystem is distinct in its complexity, involving the exchange of data among a diverse array of regulated entities (REs) operating under varied regulatory environments. This complexity necessitates frequent coordination among these REs to address various operational issues such as dispute resolution, standardised agreements and common services,” the RBI said in the note.\nThe framework involves Non-Banking Financial Company-Account Aggregators (NBFC-AAs) acting as intermediaries between Financial Information Providers (FIPs) and Financial Information Users (FI-Us).\nThe entities coming under the AA ecosystem are regulated by various bodies including the RBI, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of India. The revenue department is also deemed the regulator for the Goods and Services Tax Network within this ecosystem.\n“To support smoother adoption and stabilisation, the RBI has determined it is desirable to have a dedicated SRO for the AA ecosystem,” the regulator said.\nThe Department of Regulation of the RBI has issued a “Framework for Recognising Self-Regulatory Organisation(s) for the Account Aggregator Ecosystem (SRO-AA).” This framework details the characteristics, responsibilities, eligibility criteria, and governance aspects of the SRO-AA.\nThe SRO-AA will operate within the existing regulatory framework for the AA ecosystem, the central bank said. While the technical specifications will continue to be framed and published by Reserve Bank Information Technology Private Limited (ReBIT).\nThe regulator’s decision will be final unless it asks for resubmission.\nLast August, RBI recognised the Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment (FACE) as Self-Regulatory Organisation in the FinTech Sector (SRO-FT).\nIn February, the country’s largest mobile payments firm PhonePe Group decided to exit the account aggregator business and surrender its NBFC-AA licence, citing a shift in focus to other business areas and a plan to partner with existing aggregators.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

The private lender’s stock has lost 42.45% over the past year, 8.41% in the last three months, and 9.11% in the last week alone.\nBrokerages flagged the development as a potential source of strategic instability for IndusInd Bank. Emkay Global slashed its target price by 20% to Rs 1,125 from Rs 1,400 but maintained a ‘buy’ rating, highlighting that the RBI’s move could lead to a management transition and uncertainty over the bank’s strategic direction. The revised target price suggests a potential upside of nearly 27% from the current levels.\nNuavama was more bearish, citing concerns over a weak microfinance cycle, a lack of earnings visibility, and the possibility of an external CEO appointment in the near future. The brokerage said it expects continued stock pressure despite recent declines.\nKathpalia, who has led IndusInd Bank for five years, has overseen a strong recovery in the stock, which had more than doubled from Rs 398 to Rs 936 before recent declines. However, concerns over asset quality, particularly in the microfinance segment, and management stability have weighed on investor sentiment.\nThe RBI’s decision marks a departure from its usual practice of approving three-year terms for bank chiefs, further fueling speculation about the regulator’s reservations regarding the bank’s leadership and strategic direction.

The Reserve Bank said it will conduct a USD/INR Buy/Sell swap auction of $10 billion later this month to inject liquidity into the banking system. The swap auction for a tenor of thirty-six months will be conducted on March 24, the RBI stated in a press release.\nThe swap, it added, will be in the nature of a simple buy/sell foreign exchange swap from the Reserve Bank. A bank shall sell US dollars to the RBI and simultaneously agree to buy the same amount of US dollars at the end of the swap period.\n“The market participants would be required to place their bids in terms of the premium that they are willing to pay to the Reserve Bank for the tenor of the swap, expressed in paisa terms up to two decimal places. The auction cut-off would be based on the premium. The auction would be a multiple-price based auction, i.e., successful bids will get accepted at their respective quoted premium,” the central bank said in a statement.\nOnce the auction window is closed, RBI said, all the bids would be arranged in descending order of the swap premium quoted and the cut-off premium would be arrived at the premium corresponding to the notified US dollar amount of the auction. “Successful bidders would be those who have placed their bids at or above the cut-off premium. All bids lower than the cut-off premium would be rejected,” it added.\nThe minimum bid size would be $10 million and in multiples of $1 million thereafter, the central bank informed while maintaining that the eligible participants are allowed to submit multiple bids.\nMeanwhile, the rupee depreciated by 45 paise to close at 87.33 on Monday. This is the steepest single-day decline since February 25, pressured by dollar bids spurred by the maturity of positions in non-deliverable forwards (NDF) and a fall in the Chinese yuan.", "text_len": 1932}

Kathpalia’s term, originally set to end on March 24, 2025, will now conclude on March 23, 2026.\nRBI & IndusInd Bank did not respond to an email query seeking clarification.\nThe bank’s board had initially approved a three-year term for Kathpalia in September 2024. However, this is the second instance in which the RBI has granted a shorter tenure than proposed by the board. In March 2023, the RBI had approved a two-year term instead of the three years recommended by the bank.\nIn a recent analyst call Kathpalia had addressed concerns around his tenure, adding that the banking regulator might have had reservations about his leadership skills.\n“I don't know what is the rationale for them (RBI) to give me one year, but I think they're uncomfortable with the way my leadership skills of running the bank is, and we have to respect that,” he said. “And I think this is a test for the bank, as well as from a succession point that we see how to take the bank forward. I remain committed for one year to the bank. The board will evaluate external and internal candidates for CEO position. I don't know whether they evaluate me, or whether they evaluate somebody else. That's for the board to decide.”\nIndusInd Bank disclosed on Monday that it has launched an internal review of a portion of its derivative portfolio after discovering discrepancies in account balances. The bank estimates these discrepancies could result in a financial impact of approximately 2.35% of its net worth, with analysts projecting a potential loss of nearly Rs 1,600 crore in the March quarter.\nThe issues stemmed from internal trades involving low-liquidity instruments, such as 3 to 6-year yen and 8 to 10-year dollar borrowings. Rather than directly hedging foreign currency borrowings and deposits with external counterparties, the bank used its internal desk for the hedging process.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

Per the report, the central bank is taking note of the hedging positions entered into by banks and is collating details of these trades.\nOne of the persons aware of the matter told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity, “The RBI has contacted banks to assess the hedging positions after the IndusInd Bank issue.”\nThe sources further added that the purpose of this exercise is twofold – One is to ascertain if more banks are in non-compliance with the new derivative trades rule. Second, the RBI also wants to use this opportunity to assess the internal compliance of banks on the treasury front.\nAccording to the RBI Master Direction- Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks (Directions), 2023, banks have to categorise their derivatives portfolio into three fair value hierarchies —Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 and disclose it in their financial statements. Per the direction, banks are not to pay dividends out of net unrealised gains recognised in the profit and loss account arising on fair valuation of Level 3 derivatives assets and liabilities on their balance sheet. Such net unrealised gains on Level 3 derivatives shall be deducted from CET 1 capital.\nIn a regulatory filing on March 10, IndusInd Bank had said that an internal review of its derivative portfolio revealed discrepancies, which could hit its net worth by approximately 2.35 per cent as of December 2024. In parallel, the Bank also informed that it has appointed a reputed external agency to independently review and validate the internal findings.\nThe findings came just days after the Bank had informed that the RBI granted its approval for re-appointment of Sumant Kathpalia as MD & CEO of IndusInd Bank for a further period of one year, despite the Bank’s board requesting a three-year reappointment.\nAfter the almost 27 per cent cut on March 11, IndusInd Bank stock opened trade on March 12, down another 7 per cent.

That echoes well with the pro-growth sentiments at the reconstituted monetary policy committee (MPC) headed by the new central bank governor Sanjay Malhotra. It looks like the RBI will continue to pump in more money to bridge the liquidity shortage in the system and thereby positively influence the credit growth to the productive sectors.\nIn fact, ever since Malhotra took over as the RBI Governor, the central bank’s stance has unmistakably shifted towards supporting growth. The dogged focus on retail inflation that defined RBI policy for over two years is now making way for a more flexible approach. Liquidity, once scarce, is now flowing back into the system in massive volumes.\nThe numbers tell the story. Since Malhotra’s appointment on December 11, 2024, the RBI has pumped around Rs 51.28 lakh crore into the banking system through an aggressive mix of short-term and durable liquidity measures. This includes Rs 18.27 lakh crore in normal variable rate repo (VRR) auctions, Rs 31.56 lakh crore in daily VRR auctions, Rs 1 lakh crore in open market purchases, and a foreign currency buy-sell swap worth Rs 1.3 lakh crore.\nLiquidity shortages have fluctuated wildly—from Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 3 lakh crore on different days between mid-December and mid-February. While the deficit has now eased to Rs 54,000 crore as of March 5, the RBI is not taking any chances. It has announced fresh open market operations (OMO) worth Rs 1 lakh crore in two tranches (March 12 and March 18) and a USD/INR Buy/Sell Swap auction worth $10 billion on March 24.\nThese moves are both strategic and urgent, given the fragility of the current financial landscape.\nBy opting for staggered OMO auctions, the RBI is not just replenishing bank reserves but also sending a clear signal—it will act decisively to maintain stability. The stakes are high. The current liquidity crunch stems from multiple factors: global economic uncertainties, domestic credit pressures, and external market shocks. Left unchecked, these could snowball into a systemic financial crisis. The planned swap auction is another critical step to counter currency volatility, which, if mismanaged, could amplify domestic liquidity constraints.\nHowever, the question is whether what it has done on the liquidity front already is enough? As mentioned above, experts already pitch for an additional injection of Rs 2-3 lakh crore into the banking system to truly support growth. The flip side? A fresh surge in liquidity could stoke inflationary pressures, undoing the RBI’s hard-won price stability.\nSo, will the central bank keep the liquidity taps open risking a resurgence in the inflation? That's a tough call to make.\n(Banking Central is a weekly column that keeps a close watch on and connects the dots regarding the sector's most important events for readers.)\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

However, the stock recovered slightly the next day. This financial mess, which might not directly harm ordinary depositors, has once again drawn attention to bank deposit insurance. Earlier on several occasions, the RBI has taken preemptive or sometimes reactive measures and imposed restrictions on beleaguered lenders.\nHow safe is your money with DICGC?\nThe Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), guarantees a maximum of Rs 5 lakh deposited in a bank in case of failure, bankruptcy, or cancellation of license of a bank.\nWhich banks are covered by DICGC?\nAccording to the RBI, DICGC covers all commercial banks (such as SBI, IndusInd, ICICI, and all small finance banks) as well as state, central, and urban cooperative banks. However, this insurance does not apply to primary cooperative societies.\nAlso read: Are your bank deposits safe? Concerns rise amid IndusInd Bank saga\nWhat is the maximum insurance limit for a depositor?\nDICGC provides insurance protection up to Rs 5 lakh, which includes all bank accounts (such as savings, fixed, current and RD accounts).\nExample: If you have made a fixed deposit of Rs 4 lakh and earned Rs 1.5 lakh interest, DICGC will provide insurance only up to Rs 5 lakh (Rs 4 lakh principal + Rs 1 lakh interest). The remaining Rs 50,000 interest will not be covered.\nHowever, this limit applies differently to each bank, so it is considered wise to invest in different banks to reduce risk.\nWill the insurance limit increase?\nIn 2020, the deposit insurance cover was increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. But after the New India Co-operative Bank crisis, there is a demand to increase it to ₹10 lakh.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was also asked a question on this issue in Parliament, to which she replied: “DICGC may propose to the government to increase the deposit insurance limit, keeping in mind its financial position and the interests of the banking system of the country.” However, at present, DICGC has not made any such proposal.", "text_len": 2221}

The review, initiated as per the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) directions on investment portfolios, estimated an adverse impact of around 2.35 percent of the bank’s net worth as of December 2024.\nMarket experts estimate the potential impact to be around Rs 1,500 crore.

However, the lender reassured that its profitability and capital adequacy remain strong enough to absorb this one-time impact.\n2) Uncertainty Over Leadership Transition: Investor were concerned after the RBI granted a shorter-than-expected extension to the tenure of CEO Sumant Kathpalia.

Additionally, asset quality deteriorated, with gross non-performing assets (NPA) rising to 2.25 per cent from 2.11 per cent in the previous quarter and 1.92 per cent a year earlier.\n4) MFI woes: IndusInd Bank, a private sector lender, put microfinance loans worth Rs 1,573 crore up for sale after facing persistent asset quality challenges in its microfinance portfolio in December 2024.\nAccording to Nuvama, the RBI has favoured external candidates for leadership positions in recent appointments. If this trend continues at IndusInd, it could add to near-term earnings uncertainty, particularly given the already weak outlook for the microfinance segment.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

This is essential for transmission of rate cuts,\" Sengupta said.\nLiquidity in the banking system has also been under stress in the last few months due to slower government spending, interventions in the foreign exchange market by the RBI, and heavy selling by foreign portfolio investors in Indian equities.\nTo support liquidity in the banking system, the RBI has since late 2024 infused around Rs 3 lakh crore worth of durable liquidity, tapping a combination of VRR or variable rate repo auctions, swaps and OMOs.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Currently, the repo rate is 6.25%.\n“I expect two more rate cuts of 25 bps each in April and June…and then risks of one or two more if extreme weather remains at bay,” said Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ Research. “I believe the RBI may have to lower their FY26 inflation forecast by 20-30 bps eventually,” he added.\nThe RBI has projected CPI inflation to average 4.2% in FY26, down from 4.8% in FY25.\nFor Q4FY25, RBI had estimated inflation to average 4.4%, but with the latest print of 3.61%, economists expect March quarter’s CPI print at 3.8-4%, and for the full year at 4.7%.\nMadan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, also expects a 50 bps rate cut in total — one in April and the other in August. “RBI will wait and see how the monsoon takes off and behaves before the third cut,” he said.\nThe calls for successive rate cuts have grown louder after GDP data, released last month, showed that India’s economic growth has been slower this year than previously thought.\nThe National Statistical Office (NSO) in February revealed the revised GDP growth figure of 9.2% for FY24, 100 bps more than its provisional estimate of 8.2%. This means growth likely slowed sharply by 2.7 percentage points (pps) in FY25 (6.5% estimated by NSO) than 1.7 pps thought previously.\n“Monetary policy should be supportive of growth as inflation is clearly moving to the target on a sustainable basis,” said Gaura Sen Gupta, chief economist, IDFC FIRST Bank. “The fact that inflation is moving to 4% or lower in FY26 would push up the real rate of interest to above 2%, which will put a downward pressure on growth,” she added.\nThe real rate of interest, the difference between repo rate and headline inflation rate, is seen as an equilibrium rate where growth is close to potential, alongside stable inflation, according to analysts. RBI, in July 2024, had estimated the real rate of interest to be in the range of 1.4-1.9%.\n“We now think the April meeting may be an apposite occasion for the MPC to change policy stance to convey greater conviction about the durability of this cutting cycle as well as to cement the new improved and easier liquidity regime,” said A Prasanna, chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership (I-SEC PD).\nHowever, some economists flag that even as headline inflation declines, imported inflation continues to rise. According to SBI Research, the share of imported inflation in the CPI basket rose to 31.1% in February from 1.3% in June 2024, anchored by a rise in precious metal prices, oils and fats and chemical products.\n“Thus, the pass-through of rupee depreciation will be visible in the coming months which may push CPI inflation up,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at SBI.\nQuantEco Research said in a report that the rupee’s 4.5% depreciation against the dollar since September 2024 is likely to add upside to CPI inflation in the coming months. Also, the budgetary push for domestic consumption in FY26 along with easing of the monetary policy from February 25 would likely allow corporates to pass the higher imported cost to the consumers, the report said.", "text_len": 3869}

The measures are expected to boost consumption and contribute to overall economic expansion.\n“India’s economic growth will pick up from a cyclical slowdown,” the report noted.\nGovernment spending and monetary easing are anticipated to support GDP growth, with Moody’s forecasting real GDP expansion of over 6.5% in FY26, up from 6.3% in FY25.

Stress is expected in unsecured retail loans, microfinance, and small business loans. However, banks’ profitability is likely to remain adequate, with only marginal declines in net interest margins (NIMs) despite modest rate cuts.\nLoan growth across the banking sector is expected to moderate to 11-13% in FY26, compared to an average of 17% between March 2022 and March 2024. Banks are expected to align loan growth with deposit expansion.\nInflation and monetary policy\nMoody’s stated that India’s average inflation rate will decline to 4.5% in FY26 from 4.8% in the previous fiscal year. To control inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its policy rate by 250 basis points between May 2022 and February 2023. Subsequently, in February 2025, the central bank lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%.\nThe ratings agency expects further rate cuts to be gradual, citing global economic uncertainties, including potential shifts in U.S. trade policies and currency market volatility.\n“As represented by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar against emerging market currencies in late 2024 and early 2025, the RBI is likely to adopt a cautious stance on further rate cuts,” Moody’s stated.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 2855}

Hinduja emphasised that the promoter group remains ready to inject capital, including through additional warrants, and is awaiting regulatory approval to increase its stake from 15% to 26%.\nDespite the market reaction, he assured that the bank's capital adequacy remains above 15% and is not a concern.\nShares of IndusInd Bank were trading at 654.25/piece as of 2:49 pm.\nConcerns over management\nAddressing concerns over management, Hinduja expressed full trust in the bank’s leadership, including MD Sumant Kathpalia, but deferred decisions on tenure extensions to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The sector is healthy, with improved asset quality, capital position and profitability, but there are some areas of concern too such as unsecured retail loans and micro-finance while hard gaze of the RBI and slow deposit growth also pose growth challenges.\nBad loans ratio at a 12-year low\nAsset quality of banks improved further and their gross non-performing assets (GNPA) or bad loans ratio declined to a 12-year low of 2.6 per cent in September 2024 on the back of falling slippages and steady credit demand, as per RBI. The net NPA ratio or the proportion of net non-performing assets in net loans and advances was at around 0.6 per cent, according to the RBI's December 2024 issue of the Financial Stability Report.\n\"Buoyed by falling slippages, higher write-offs and steady credit demand, the gross nonperforming assets (GNPA) ratio of 37 scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) fell to a multi-year low of 2.6 per cent,\" the report said. The improvement in asset quality of SCBs was broad-based across sectors and bank groups.\nAccording to the report, the share of large borrowers in GNPA of SCBs has steadily declined over the past two years. The asset quality of banks' large borrower portfolios has improved considerably, with the GNPA ratio falling from 4.5 per cent in March 2023 to 2.4 per cent in September 2024. In the large borrower segment, the share of standard assets in total funded amount has consistently improved over the past two years.\nNotably, none of the top 100 borrowers are classified as NPAs in September 2024. In terms of value, investment grade advances (rated BBB and above) constituted 91.5 per cent of the funded advances to large borrowers with long-term external ratings, the report said.\nHowever, the RBI also flagged concern over a sharp rise in write-offs, especially among private sector banks (PVBs), which could be partly masking worsening asset quality in unsecured lending segment and dilution in underwriting standards.\nThe report cautioned that “vulnerabilities in the form of stretched equity valuations, pockets of stress in the microfinance and consumer credit segments, and risks from external spillovers require close monitoring.”\nImproving profitability\nProfitability of SCBs improved during H1:2024-25, with profit after tax (PAT) surging by 22.2 per cent (y-o-y), the report said. Public sector banks (PSBs) and PVBs recorded PAT growth of 30.2 per cent and 20.2 per cent, respectively, while foreign banks (FBs) experienced single digit growth (8.9 per cent). RBI said the banking stability indicator (BSI), which provides an assessment of the resilience of the domestic banking system, showed further improvement during H1:2024-25. The resilience of the domestic banking system has been bolstered by robust capital buffers, strong earnings and sustained improvement in asset quality.\nA significant profit milestone awaits India's public sector banks in 2024-25, and low NPAs and healthy credit growth are likely to combine to drive their profits past the Rs 1.5 lakh crore mark during the FY, PTI had reported in December citing official data. These banks already saw profits rise 25% to Rs 85,520 crore in the first half of the fiscal year compared to the same period last year. This positive trend builds on a record Rs 1.41 lakh crore profit in 2023-24, thanks to improved asset quality, lending, capital reserves, and returns. The gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio dropped to 3.12% in September 2024 from a high of 14.58% in March 2018. The Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) reached 15.43% in September 2024, significantly higher than the 11.5% mandated by the RBI. The RBI's 2015 Asset Quality Review and subsequent reforms are credited with turning around the banks' performance. PSBs have returned Rs 61,964 crore in dividends to shareholders over the last three years. Anticipated rate cuts by the Monetary Policy Committee could further boost credit demand.\nLiquidity coverage ratio\nThe liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) for banks, tested by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on two stress scenarios, showed that almost no bank would fail to maintain LCR above the minimum requirement of 100%. As of September 2024, all banks have maintained LCR comfortably above the regulatory requirement of 100%. The average banking system LCR declined to 128.5% over the year, from 135.7% in September 2023 due to an increase in net cash outflows. The LCR for public sector banks declined sharply to 127.4% from 142.1% in September 2023, while the LCR for private sector banks stood at 126.1% as of September 2024.\nPoor deposit growth\nIndian banks are advancing more loans than they are incrementally garnering deposits, the latest central bank data showed, pointing to only a partial success for dedicated lender programmes aimed at boosting the deposit base and de-risking the credit environment, ET has reported. The banking sector's incremental loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) on a three-month rolling basis reached nearly 126% as of February 7, 2025. The incremental LDR stands at 103% so far this fiscal year, pointing to the persisting weakness in deposit mobilisation despite more circumspect advances toward unsecured loans and non-bank financing. As of February 7, credit climbed 11.3% year-on-year, while deposits saw a more modest increase of 10.6%.\nAn analysis by India Ratings highlights that deposits have consistently trailed the banking system's credit growth since FY22, with an average gap of 416 basis points. This disparity has pushed system-wide LDR higher, reaching 80.4% in the first half of the current fiscal year. A rising LDR indicates that banks are increasingly relying on borrowed funds or other means to fund their credit growth rather than deposits, which could limit their lending capacity in the medium term.\nA report by Motilal Oswal Securities underscores the competitive pressures banks are facing. It notes that many banks are focusing on enhancing their credit-deposit (CD) ratios, leading to heightened competition for deposits. At the same time, public sector banks are also becoming more competitive, further intensifying the battle for depositors' funds.\nConcerns over micro lending\nSmall finance banks with a higher share of micro loans are in the most challenging situation with the ongoing stress in the microfinance sector, which saw the average gross non-performing assets (NPA) rising to an 18-month high of 11.6% at the end of September 2024. As a group, these lenders had 15.3% of their cumulative microfinance portfolio as NPAs. Industry-level data till end of December is not available just yet, but the overall sectoral asset quality is likely to worsen, quarterly earnings showed.\nET reported in January that the RBI developed ‘supervisory discomfort’ with a couple of small finance banks (SFBs) due to high concentration risks and rising asset quality stress. The banking regulator has also told these banks to explore mergers to gain scale and minimise concentration risks, three executives tracking the sector said. “Small finance banks are under the ‘close supervision’ of RBI,” said one of the persons. “Amalgamation between banks is one of the options that have been thought of at the regulatory level to address the concerns.”\nNon-performing assets in the microfinance sector surged to an all-time high of Rs 50,000 crore, or 13% of the gross loans, at the end of December last year, ET reported on February 27. The portfolio at risk that may turn NPA rose to 3.2% of the total loans, from 1% a year ago, reflecting a severe deterioration in overall credit discipline. Consolidated data isn't available on stressed unsecured advances at NBFCs, with fintech-led non-bank lenders involved in the business of riskier personal loans often taken as a proxy to assess the extent of the value at risk. The Fintech Association for Consumer Empowerment, a self-regulatory body, said personal loans outstanding by fintech companies dropped to Rs 66,683 crore at the end of September 2024, compared with Rs 74,057 crore a quarter ago. Unpaid loans over 90 days increased to 3.4% from 3.2% in the same period.\nRecently, the RBI lowered the capital buffer lenders needed to assign against such loans after having raised the risk weights nearly 15 months ago. It restored the older risk weights on loans to NBFCs effective April 1, and those on microfinance lenders and borrowers immediately.\n\"Sanjay Malhotra, the new Reserve Bank of India governor, is right to unwind some of his predecessor’s hawkish controls on a runaway consumer-credit boom,\" Bloomberg columnist Andy Mukherjee has written recently. \"There was a time to throw sand in the wheels of commerce. Right now, though, a sputtering growth engine needs lubrication. Still, Malhotra must be cautious. There is a crack in the structure of the world’s fastest-growing major economy. Speeding up subprime loans could be risky down the road.\"\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 9367}

Ashok Hinduja, chairman of IndusInd International Holdings Ltd, emphasized that the bank’s net worth is around ₹65,000 crore, and the lender would absorb any setback arising from these discrepancies.\nMumbai: Ashok Hinduja, chairman of IndusInd International Holdings Ltd (IIHL), the promoter of IndusInd Bank, expressed complete confidence in the ability of the bank’s managing director (MD) and chief executive officer Sumant Kathpalia to steer the bank through its challenges. Hinduja’s backing came on a day when IndusInd Bank’s stock dropped 27.17% to its 52-week low. In an interview with Mint, Hinduja pointed out that the bank’s net worth of ₹65,102 crore and other key metrics were adequate to absorb any setbacks arising from discrepancies of approximately ₹1,530 crore in the derivatives account balances. Edited excerpts:\nWill the recent discrepancies flagged in the derivatives portfolio impact MD Sumant Kathpalia’s tenure?\nRBI (Reserve Bank of India) has reappointed him for one year. He already clarified that he came to know there was an issue in October, and they have also appointed a third-party agency. So why will it be a problem for him? It’s a five-seven-year-old issue from when he was not heading the bank.\nAlso read | IndusInd Bank’s investors scream trust is not meant to be broken\nWhat immediate steps are you planning to restore investor confidence?\nI’m not a part of the day-to-day operations of the bank, nor am I on the board. I have told the market and investors that our full support is there, like it always has been in the past. In the business of banking, problems may arise for many a reason—technical or employee-led. Luckily, it is not a fraud; that part is clear.\nThe question of confidence is only because of the hit to the bank, but the balance sheet is strong. The bank has also guided that it will continue to report a profit in Q4FY25 after adjusting for all this. The net worth is around ₹65,000 crore and a hit of ₹1,500 crore is not very big. Then there is also the question of hiking the promoter stake to 26% from 15%. RBI has given us in-principle approval but there are procedures, so we’re awaiting the final approval now.\nCould this uncertainty impact RBI’s decision to allow for the hike in promoter stake?\nNo, why? Even after all this, the capital adequacy is still 15.5%, which is much more than the required 12.5-13%. If foreign capital is coming to the bank, it will make the bank stronger.\nI’ve extended my full support, trust and confidence in the MD and to the board. I’ve also said that this is not a big thing. Global banks have these problems in treasuries and derivatives, and at times errors or glitches can happen. These things happen, but one should not panic. What I saw today was that investors were panicked. They should not panic. The balance sheet is strong and this hit will not make a big difference. So, it’s only a question of confidence and that’s why I have given this clarity.\nAlso read | IndusInd Bank flags lapses worth ₹1,530 crore in derivatives portfolio\nBut 51% of the promoter stake is pledged?\nThe pledge is because being a holding company, we have to acquire more businesses to create more things. IndusInd International Holdings Ltd (IIHL) has acquired a bank in the Bahamas, and we have invested in an exchange called Afrinex in Mauritius. So, we have other businesses and funds were raised immediately when they were required. Additionally, IIHL went in for a buyback of shares from some of the investors who wanted to exit.\nCould the lenders now demand more shares to be pledged?\nAs of now, we have no further pledge, and any margin call that comes in, IIHL will make the payment. As of now, there is no need for a further pledge.\nAre you worried about succession planning because you may have to look for a new MD in a year?\nKathpalia has already said that he will continue to grow the institution, and he has shown a good turnaround. Since he came in 2020, he has seen a lot of crises, but he has cleaned up the books. Then, he faced the problems of microfinance and commercial vehicles. He put in place the provisioning and did the work, and now microfinance is doing well, owing to regulatory guidelines from RBI.\nAlso read | IndusInd Bank faces a 2.35% net-worth erosion. What does it mean?\nAs far as looking for a new person is concerned, the bank will start their exercise and provide two-three names. Maybe Kathpalia’s name will also go along with others, and if he’s still doing a good job in six-eight months, maybe RBI would like him to continue.\nWill this impact the takeover of Reliance Capital?\nNo, because IIHL is a separate entity. The first transaction for the domestic equity component for ₹3,250 crore was concluded yesterday (Monday. About ₹2,500 crore has already been deposited towards the overseas 74% equity component. Balance ₹4,300 crore for the remaining stake in the domestic company is also under process and hopefully by the weekend, the transaction should go through.", "text_len": 5174}

CA Nitin Kaushik, a finance expert, took to social media to highlight a decade of stagnation for the bank’s stock:\n\"IndusInd Bank – A decade of zero returns! If you had invested ₹1000 in Sep 2014, it would still be ₹1000 in 2025. No growth in 10+ years. 🔴 Stock fell 27% due to accounting issues 🔴 50% promoter holdings are pledged 🔴 CFO resigned, CEO got just a 1-year extension from RBI. A stock trading below book value doesn’t always mean it’s a bargain. Do your research before investing!\"\nWhat Went Wrong at IndusInd Bank?\nThe stock crash came after a series of troubling developments. A day earlier, on Monday, IndusInd Bank had already fallen by 6% following the news that its CEO, Sumant Kathpalia, received only a one-year extension from the RBI instead of the expected three-year term. Market confidence was further shaken by the bank’s weak third-quarter results, which saw a 39% year-on-year drop in net profit and a rise in non-performing assets (NPAs).But the biggest blow came from an internal audit that revealed a serious miscalculation in the bank’s forex hedging costs. Over the past five to seven years, IndusInd Bank had been incorrectly accounting for its hedging expenses in foreign exchange transactions, leading to a cumulative impact of Rs 2,100 crore on its net worth.\nThe RBI Steps In: Could Other Banks Be Affected?\nThe scale of IndusInd Bank’s accounting error has prompted the Reserve Bank of India to take action. According to reports, the RBI has reached out to several major banks to assess their forex derivative positions and ensure their hedging effectiveness. The regulator’s swift intervention suggests concerns that IndusInd Bank may not be the only lender with similar miscalculations.This comes at a time when India’s banking sector is largely seen as having moved past its legacy bad loan problems. The sector has seen a significant improvement in asset quality, with NPAs dropping to a 12-year low of 2.6% in September 2024. However, as recent events show, risks remain.\nBanking Sector Strengths and Lingering Risks\nBad Loans at Record Lows\nThe Indian banking system has made significant progress in reducing bad loans. According to RBI data, the gross NPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks fell to 2.6% in September 2024, down from 4.5% in March 2023. Even among large borrowers, asset quality has improved, with the NPA ratio dropping to 2.4%. Notably, none of the top 100 borrowers were classified as NPAs as of September 2024.Profitability on the Rise\nProfitability in the sector has also improved. The profit after tax (PAT) for scheduled commercial banks grew by 22.2% year-on-year in the first half of FY 2024-25. Public sector banks saw the strongest growth at 30.2%, while private sector banks posted a 20.2% increase. Robust earnings and capital buffers have strengthened overall banking resilience.Lingering Concerns: Deposit Growth and Microfinance Stress\nDespite these improvements, challenges persist. Deposit growth remains sluggish, with the incremental loan-to-deposit ratio reaching 126% as of February 2025. Banks are lending at a faster pace than they are attracting deposits, raising concerns about long-term liquidity sustainability.Meanwhile, stress in the microfinance sector is mounting. The gross NPA ratio for microfinance loans hit 11.6% in September 2024, the highest in 18 months. Some small finance banks have been placed under ‘close supervision’ by the RBI due to their high exposure to risky micro-loans.\nInvestor Sentiment and Brokerage Reactions\nWhile IndusInd Bank’s stock recovered slightly on Wednesday, rising 4.43% to Rs 685, investor sentiment remains fragile. Several brokerages have issued warnings about the bank’s governance and credibility:- Morgan Stanley flagged further downside risks.\n- Macquarie raised concerns over internal processes.\n- Kotak Securities downgraded the stock to ‘reduce’, warning that it could take multiple quarters to regain trust.\nWhat Lies Ahead for IndusInd Bank?\nThe immediate priority for IndusInd Bank is damage control. The bank must restore investor confidence by strengthening its governance, improving transparency, and addressing its accounting lapses. The RBI’s ongoing review of forex derivative practices across the sector will likely bring further scrutiny.In the broader banking landscape, the sector remains fundamentally strong, but pockets of risk—such as unsecured lending and slow deposit growth—need close monitoring. As financial markets digest the implications of IndusInd Bank’s crisis, investors will be watching closely to see how the bank navigates the road ahead.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 5011}

According to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) payment system report released in January 2025, UPI transactions surged from 34% of digital payments in 2019 to 83% in 2024, highlighting its transformative impact on the broader payments ecosystem. However, as the affinity for digital transactions soars, so does the sophistication of fraudsters who prey on consumers. The fraud landscape has shifted from individual actors to organized syndicates. While payment transactions in India enjoy unique protection layer requiring two factors of authentication (2FA) for every transaction, fraudsters have been able to work around these through either convincing the customer to transfer money on false pretexts or through injecting malwares in customer’s phones leading to compromise of the 2FA protocols. The surge in such fraud cases undermines the trust between customers, digital platforms and regulators.\nReports indicate that the volume of fraud cases has increased dramatically over the last year (2023-2024), with some estimates suggesting a fourfold rise. According to RBI, there were approximately 1.5 crore fraud incidents reported in the first half of FY25 alone, amounting to a staggering INR 21,367 crore in losses. This alarming trend underscores the urgent need for robust measures, financial literacy, technological prowess to enhance secure experiences and strengthen trust within the digital payment’s ecosystem.\nA View into Burgeoning Digital Scams\nAs the success of digital payments unfolds across India and internationally, it faces a growing challenge: increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes targeting its users using organized setups. With more than 69 crore smartphone users in India growing at more than 3% pa, scamsters target these smart phones to perpetrate frauds. Nearly 15 crore scam calls are attempted in the country daily. These include: online banking frauds, phishing scams, SIM swap fraud, credit/debit card fraud, identity theft, online shopping fraud, investment scams, and malware attacks.\nFraudsters lure customers into fake investment schemes with promises of unusually high returns, often using platforms like Telegram to create a sense of legitimacy. Initially, customers deposit small amounts, which are followed by inflated returns, building trust and leading to larger investments. When customers attempt to withdraw, fake apps impose high fees, resulting in even more significant losses. Digital Arrests”, where fraudsters impersonate law enforcement officials to deceive their victims have become common too and gullible customers have lost crores of their life savings to these scams.\nAs per Ministry of Finance, UPI fraud cases alone surged by 85% in FY24; the number of incidents rose from 7.25 lakh in FY23 to 13.42 lakh translating to thousands of frauds being reported every day. The financial impact of these UPI frauds escalated to ₹1,087 crore in FY24from ₹573 crore in FY23. But the unreported numbers may be larger as these attempts now touch each one of us almost daily. Cyber frauds now eclipse the value of physical frauds for law enforcement agencies. These figures are not just statistics but a resounding wake-up call to the ecosystem to fortify security measures and enhance consumer protections.\nYour Best Weapon Against Fraud? Knowledge and Vigilance\nTo combat rising fraud, a multi-faceted approach involving government, regulators, and industry players is necessary. The government has initiated educational campaigns to inform consumers about potential scams. Prime Minister Narendra Modi cautioned citizens about the “digital arrest” scam in October 2024. The National Cybercrime Reporting Portal (cybercrime.gov.in) and helpline 1930 enable users to report suspicious activities, while public awareness campaigns via SMS, radio, and advisories educate citizens on protecting themselves from cyber threats.\nAdditionally, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has implemented pre-emptive measures, such as caller tunes that alert users about potential scams. While these messages may initially alarm customers, they play a crucial role in raising awareness and encouraging vigilance against cyber fraud.\nTechnology At the Heart of It\nBuilding trust in digital payments transcends policy and technology—it’s about placing consumers at the heart of the ecosystem, ensuring a secure and seamless experience at every touchpoint. Financial institutions have implemented multiple advanced security measures to mitigate fraud. These include multi-factor authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of security before account access, and device binding, which restricts transactions to pre-registered devices.\nThe fintech industry is also using cutting-edge AI technologies to detect fraud. Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are now emerging at the forefront of fraud detection, analyzing user behavior and transaction patterns in real time. Security systems are moving beyond “at the gate” or “at Payment” to a continuous risk evaluation of customer accounts using thousands of risk signals. Traditional machine learning and data analytics complement these technologies, examining vast amounts of behavioral, device, and transactional data to predict potential fraud and recommend preventive actions. Predictive analytics can anticipate future fraud, while visual analytics monitors transactions for anomalies using intuitive dashboards.\nWhile the industry leverages advanced technology to combat fraud, regulatory bodies are simultaneously strengthening the institutional framework to create a more secure digital payment ecosystem. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is set to soon mandate Cyber Resilience and Digital Payment Security Controls for non-bank Payment System Operators (PSOs) that includes a slew of security measures to be followed by the industry thereby ensuring a baseline layer of security for customers across players. Additionally, systems like the Central Payment Fraud Information Registry (CPFIR) and MuleHunter AI will support financial institutions in detecting and mitigating mule accounts. These proactive efforts by regulators aim to enhance the security of the digital payments landscape.\nStronger Together for A Safer Ecosystem\nThe fight against digital fraud isn’t just a technical battle—it’s a collective responsibility. From financial institutions and technology providers to policymakers and everyday users, each of us plays a crucial role in creating a safer digital environment. Together, by combining education, advanced technologies, and strong regulations, we can protect consumers and improve trust in the digital payment ecosystem.\nDisclaimer\nViews expressed above are the author's own.\nTop Comment\n{{A_D_N}}\n{{C_D}}\n{{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}}...

A Reuters poll of economists predicted inflation at 3.98 per cent, driven by a slowdown in vegetable, pulse, and cereal prices.

A lower inflation and below trend growth may lead to ‘more than consensus’ rate cut in the next MPC meeting. Aastha Gudwani, India Chief Economist, Barclays, said, “While our base case remains that the MPC will deliver another 25bp cut at the April meeting and retain the ‘neutral’ stance of monetary policy, we now think there is a possibility of a larger, non-standard 35bp cut at that meeting.” February CPI inflation was down 65 basis points in comparison to January 2025 and is the lowest year-on-year inflation after July 2024.\nEasy case for easing\nWith headline and core inflation both expected to average around the 4 per cent target but growth below trend, Nomura said, current policy rates are restrictive, and further easing towards neutral, and then into accommodative territory is likely. Additionally, the RBI is also addressing liquidity tightness pro-actively. This, the analysis report said, could ultimately shift the system into a surplus, in order to improve the transmission of rate cuts. “Against the consensus view of ~50bp of additional easing, we continue to expect 75bp of further cuts to a terminal rate of 5.50 per cent by end 2025, with 25bp cuts each in April, June and August,” said Sonal Varma, MD and Chief Economist for India and Asia excluding Japan at Nomura.\nInflation might increase marginally in March\nData so far in March suggest food prices rising, led by vegetables, fruit and meat & fish – partly on seasonality, however, Nomura expects lower prices for pulses and eggs and a moderate increase for milk. Barring a rise on gold prices, other core categories should remain capped. “On net, CPI inflation is tracking at ~3.8 per cent YoY in March from 3.6 per cent in February, while core inflation may ease to 3.9 per cent from 4.1 per cent,” said Sonal Varma while maintaining that CPI inflation is likely to remain below 4 per cent in H1 2025 (RBI: 4.5 per cent) and average to around 4.2 per cent in FY26 (RBI: 4.2 per cent).\nBarclays too forecasted March CPI inflation at 3.8 per cent YoY, given early data from retail food prices and recent increases in transportation fares in Maharashtra. “Accordingly, we see Q4FY25 inflation averaging 3.9 per cent, ~50bp lower than the MPC’s forecast (4.4 per cent as of February 7),” said Aastha Gudwani.\nTo put things in perspective, beyond March, the combination of robust crop output and the government’s sensitivity to price flare-ups should lead to lower food inflation this year. That said, India is also experiencing early signs of a heatwave (expected to last until May), which if it materialises, could pose a risk to rabi crop output. Meanwhile, weak domestic demand and deflation in manufacturing input costs should keep core inflation subdued.\nThe background\nFebruary CPI inflation, led by lower food prices, moderated sharply to 3.6 per cent YoY. Food and beverages inflation eased to 3.8 per cent YoY from 5.7 per cent in January. This drop was driven by a double-digit monthly price contraction in vegetables (-11.2 per cent MoM, nsa), eggs (-5.3 per cent), pulses (-3.6 per cent), and spices (-0.8 per cent). Large price increases were limited to fruit and sugar, with most other categories recording a flat to modest rise.\nCore CPI inflation, meanwhile, rose more than expected, to 4.1 per cent YoY in February from 3.6 per cent in January. The uptick, Nomura explained, was led by gold prices (2.8 per cent MoM, nsa), which pushed up personal care CPI inflation, but all other core sub-categories remain subdued. “Indeed, on a 3-month saar basis, core inflation ex-commodities (petrol, diesel, gold and silver) was flat at 3.1 per cent. The 20 per cent trimmed mean moderated to 3.3 per cent YoY in February from 3.4 per cent in January, core goods (ex-key commodities) inflation was flat at 2.8 per cent, and core services inflation inched up only slightly to 3.7 per cent from 3.6 per cent. The muted performance of core inflation suggests domestic demand remains soft,” the Nomura report stated.\nIndustrial activity\nFurthermore, industrial production growth rose to 5.0 per cent YoY in January from an upwardly revised 3.5 per cent in December. Sequential momentum also rose to 1.5 per cent MoM sa, from 0.3 per cent in December, led by a broad-based pickup across infrastructure and construction, consumer durable and non-durable goods production, suggesting improved consumption and investment activity in January.", "text_len": 4717}

The bonds were originally issued by HDFC.\nA higher CD ratio implies a bank's total loan book exceeds deposits, and therefore, it is borrowing money from the market for lending. Although the bonds purchased represent a small part of HDFC Bank's outstanding borrowings of ₹4 lakh crore as of March-end 2024, market participants are expecting more such actions in the coming weeks.\nBritish two-year government bond yields - which are sensitive to speculation about Bank of England interest rates - rose to their highest level in more than two months on Friday.\nThe trigger for the bond buyback exercise is partly due to HDFC Bank's failure to receive RBI nod to classify these bonds of its erstwhile parent as infrastructure bonds.\nA nod from the central bank would have lowered the lender's cost of funds since infrastructure bonds do not attract regulatory ratios such as a 4% cash reserve ratio that does not fetch any interest and an 18% statutory reserve ratio, yielding lower interest as against giving loans.\nA fraction of these long-term bonds of HDFC, now on the bank's books, are priced as high as 9.6%, data available from HDFC Bank's filing with US Securities and Exchange Commission showed.\nIn February last week, the bank is estimated to have bought ₹2,500 crore worth of bonds due 2033 from insurance companies, said the people cited above.\n\"Given the downward rate cycle, new assets will be priced at lower rates because they will be on a floating rate. Replacing high-cost bonds will support net interest margin and bring down the CD ratio,\" said the first person cited above.\nIn the December quarter, it purchased ₹4,400 crore worth of bonds, chief financial officer Srinivasan Vaidyanathan told analysts in a post-earnings call in January.\n\"It is easy for a bank to degrow its loan book by simply not lending. The same formula may not apply on deposits, because a bank particularly with over 9,100 branches can't stop accepting deposits,\" the second person said. \"To mitigate this risk of plenty, the bank slowed the pace of lending and began replacing high-cost debt with low-cost deposits and simultaneously started buying back high-cost bonds issued by HDFC.\"\nHDFC Bank did not reply to emailed queries until Tuesday press time.\nAfter the merger, the lender's CD ratio rose sharply mainly because, unlike the bank, HDFC relied on bonds to fund its loan book. Roughly 40-45% of HDFC's borrowings were through bonds and commercial papers. Post-merger, the bank extinguished the entire ₹75,000 crore worth of commercial papers, but bonds raised by the parent remained on its books.\nThe bank informed investors in July 2024 at its annual shareholder meeting that it would aim to lower its loan book as it adjusts to the merger.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

However, banking industry representatives have formally submitted a proposal to the Union government, recommending the reintroduction of MDR for businesses with an annual Goods and Services Tax (GST)-linked turnover exceeding Rs 40 lakh.\nTiered Pricing Model Under Consideration\nThe government is reportedly evaluating a tiered pricing system, where larger merchants would pay higher charges while smaller merchants—those with an annual turnover below Rs 40 lakh—would continue to enjoy free UPI transactions.\n“If large merchants accepting Visa and Mastercard debit cards, as well as credit cards, are paying MDR, there is no reason why they should not pay a charge for UPI and RuPay debit cards,” a senior banker told ET.\nMerchants previously paid MDR of less than 1% on transaction values before the government removed the fee in the Union Budget for FY22 to promote digital payments. However, with UPI now dominating retail payments and RuPay gaining popularity, banking executives argue that the blanket waiver should end, according to ET.\nRevenue Concerns for Payment Aggregators\nIndustry leaders assert that reinstating MDR is essential to maintaining the viability of payment service providers. “Payment companies are now regulated under PA-Online rules, which have significantly increased compliance costs. Without MDR, these businesses could become unsustainable,” a banker explained, reported ET.\nAdditionally, the government has reduced its budget allocation for digital payments subsidies, slashing it from over Rs 3,500 crore to Rs 437 crore in FY25.

This came from non-compliance with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations on derivatives, enforced from April 2024. Devina Mehra, Founder & CMD of First Global, has long emphasized on the inherent risks in banking. Responding to this, Devina Mehra, in her post on LinkedIn, explained why she is a “nervous investor in banks and lenders”. She said, “It is in the structure of the business where negative surprises will always outweigh positive surprises.”\nShe highlighted how banks do not benefit proportionally when their borrowers succeed but take direct hits when things go wrong. “When banks lend and their customer does very well, unlike equity investors they do not get any extra income. In fact, on the margin they may well have to reduce interest rates. On the other hand, when something goes wrong with the borrower, the bank has to take a hit. This is one business where higher than expected growth may not be a good thing at all except that you come to know of the problems created only some years later,” Devina Mehra said.\nHer post comes just a day after IndusInd Bank announced that an internal review of its derivative portfolio revealed discrepancies, which could hit its net worth by approximately 2.35 per cent as of December 2024. As of December 31, the Bank’s net worth was at Rs 65,102 crore and the impact is likely to be around Rs 1,530 crore, which is more than Rs 1,401.3 crore net profit in the third quarter of FY25.\nShe went on to highlight another key concern – leverage. “…the risk of losses on highly leveraged trading/ investment positions (because a bank is inherently a leveraged institution) and this can deal a blow – sometimes a fatal one – to a bank,” Devina Mehra added.\nTo support her assertion, she cited two banking failures – “After all a single trader took down the 200+ year old Barings Bank and a couple of years ago the Silicon Valley Bank’s troubles also arose out of their bond book, rather than credit,” she stated.\nDevina Mehra ended her post saying, “It is at the end of the day, a highly leveraged precarious business. More important, as an outside investor, you never know where the problems are hiding in either the credit or the trading book.”\n“So yes, हम तो डर डर कर ही निवेश करते हैं।,” she said.", "text_len": 2448}

However, the next critical phase involves microeconomic reforms. “The thing that they need to address now, and it is very-very clear that the government understands this, is deregulation, ease of doing business, cutting red tape, and allowing small and medium-sized companies much freer rein to grow the economy and their labor forces,” he added.\nDespite concerns over high stock market valuations, Walker is optimistic about India’s long-term growth trajectory. “This is the time to absolutely double down on the long in India, go much-much longer. Although we worry about the valuations in the Indian stock market, my view is that economic growth is going to take off from here, and those valuations will be very quickly supported by corporate earnings.”\nIndian Bonds: A Strong Opportunity\nFor investors seeking lower risk, Walker also sees an opportunity in Indian government bonds. He expects the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut the repo rate by 75 to 100 basis points in 2024, with the possibility of further reductions in 2026. “There is very good upside in terms of not so much the yield on Indian government debt, although that is good at the moment, but the capital gains from a rising bond price,” he explained.\nVietnam: An Emerging Star on the Investment Radar\nWhile India remains a top investment choice, Walker also sees Vietnam as a hidden gem with high-growth potential. Despite being a smaller market, Vietnam’s economic dynamics and political stability make it a strong long-term bet.\n“One of the other longs that we have got in our portfolio is Vietnam, and I know it is a small country and it is kind of off most people's radar screens, but the politics in Vietnam and the growth and economic dynamics there all suggest that over the course of the next two to three years, there is going to be a very strong acceleration in the domestic economy,” he said.\nWith the country’s new general secretary consolidating power, Walker expects the Vietnamese government to prioritize economic growth, further enhancing investment prospects. “That means making sure that the economy is moving. So, I would actually be long Vietnam in that respect. I think that is still one of the best bets.”\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

Rs 23,700 crore at current prices) from the government and 30.24% from promoter LIC, along with the transfer of management control in the bank. The bidders reportedly include Fairfax India Holdings (promoter of CSB Bank), Emirates NBD, and Kotak Mahindra Bank.\nAn official said that after security clearance from the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and fit and proper evaluation by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the qualified bidders’ due diligence on IDBI Bank is almost complete.\n“Draft SPA is being finalised,” the official said, adding that final SPA negotiations takes some time to conclude.\nTo make the sale smooth, the government should give assurance in the SPA that the potential buyer would have a free hand in the running of the bank, such as a change in management, etc. According to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the voting rights of a shareholder or shareholders acting in concert in a bank can’t exceed 26% even if they own more than 26%.\nWhile deciding the terms and conditions of the strategic sale, legitimate concerns of the existing employees and other stakeholders are suitably addressed through appropriate provisions made in the share purchase agreement.\nThis will be the largest deal in the BFSI field so far in the country and overall, this will be the second largest after Flipkart-Walmart deal, officials reckon.\nWalmart acquired 77% of Flipkart for $16 billion in 2018, making it the biggest e-commerce acquisition in the world at the time.\nThe government is expecting to get some premium over the current market price of IDBI Bank given the bank’s splendid turnaround and performance in the last few years. IDBI Bank share price closed at 72.65 on Wednesday, down 0.08% from the previous closing price. At the current price, the 60.72% stake sale in the lender is worth about Rs 47,400 crore, which needs to be topped-up with some premium as well.\nThe bank’s net profit rose 31% on year to Rs 1,908 crore for the December quarter of the current financial year. The net non-performing assets (NPAs) to net advances stood at 0.18% for the quarter, down from 0.34% in the year ago quarter.\nPost-sale, the government and LIC together will have a 34% residual stake in the lender (19% by LIC and 15% by the government). At a later stage, the government will sell its residual 15% stake in tranches through offer for sale to gain from the upsides in the share price after it is acquired by a private party.", "text_len": 2850}

We are also expecting inflation to actually be at target, which is 4% after a very long wait, lower than 4.3% in the last month. What we have seen is food inflation really coming off. Over the last few months, vegetable prices have been coming off. Some pulses prices have been coming off. Eggs, meat, fish, that category has also come off a little bit. So, all of that will really help achieve this 4% target number.\nBut having said that, with food, you never really know what is going to come next. So, at least for the rest of the March and for April, we are going to keep our fingers crossed that temperatures do not become very high because March temperatures are very important for the wheat crop.\nSo, we are going to keep our eyes on wheat and sugar for the next few months. But for now, we are going to celebrate the fact that a lot of other food prices have actually come off and we are at target inflation.\nNow, we use inflation as a benchmark to understand what RBI would do. Is it too early to assume that inflation goes down, rate goes down? I mean, is that as simple as I am trying to make it sound or it will be very complex more than that?\nPranjul Bhandari: Oh, look, you can make it as complex as you want, but it is simple in a way that we are an inflation targeting central bank. Inflation was not at target for the longest. It has finally got to the target. Growth is a bit weak and therefore the RBI is doing a lot of easing. The RBI has already started and it is basically punching on all fronts. It is giving you a lot of liquidity. It is turning a lot of the temporary liquidity into slightly more long-lasting permanent liquidity. It gave you a February rate cut.\nWe are expecting another April rate cut coming up soon. It has done a bit of regulatory easing, taking off some of the lending bans to NBFCs and microcredit firms. And finally, it is also letting the rupee be a lot more flexible, which my sense is it is great for export competitiveness.\nSo, across these four fronts, the RBI is easing and my sense is this is something that will continue over the next couple of months. I am just going to keep my eyes out for wheat and sugar, two food items. Barring that, I feel comfortable saying that monetary policy easing is going to be one of the big drivers of growth in 2025.\nAlso give us a sense that what is the expectation on the IIP number because that is expected to rise, of course, and what we are expecting is a number of 3.7%, but that will be lower on a month on month basis and what are some of these macro indicators are highlighting that, well, of course, there has been a slowdown, the automobile sales are seem to be taking a backseat. Give us some sense that how do you see the number panning out?\nPranjul Bhandari: Yes, in a sort of month on month, seasonally adjusted way, how economists like to look at it, the IIP number will be slightly better than the previous month. We have also seen that in the PMI index, which comes as soon as the month is over, that there was some improvement in the month of January for which we are going to get the IIP.\nThe big driver in January is actually export orders. Globally, we are seeing that because of all the Trump tariff threats, many countries, many companies are quickly buying up things and restocking their inventories.\nAnd my sense is that is something that is benefiting manufacturing around the world and we may see some hint of that in the IIP data and I agree that a number could be around the 3.5% ballpark.\nBut this sort of leaves me with the question that once this global restocking is finished, then what will be the main driver of manufacturing and I think that is a question mark that we are still grappling with, what will really drive growth in the next couple of months?\nI can think of two candidates, one is RBI monetary policy easing, helping with a lag, but helping and the second is the rabi crop, the winter crop, which the farmers sell in the market in April, that is when they make some money and they go out and buy things from this money, for example, two wheelers.\nSo, my sense is maybe in April, we will see a little bit of that but we should be very careful, even if the number today is slightly better than the previous month, it does not mean that it is on a major uptrend.\nNow, at what point in time, I am just going to put a template that rates do not go lower by a significant manner, we can blame it on Trump, we can blame it on tariff, we can blame it on summer, we can blame it on wheat, rice, whatever we want but rates do not go down. But liquidity remains benign, which is what Reserve Bank of India is trying to do. So, when do you think the effect of this benign liquidity environment will start kicking in, which could kickstart demand, and which could also kickstart the velocity of money at the rural end and at the urban end?\nPranjul Bhandari: So, look, March can be tricky because it is fiscal year end and all corporates are looking for liquidity and then generally liquidity gets tight in March. In April, it begins to ease again. And my sense is that by the time we in the middle of April, we will be noticing that liquidity is fairly ample in the system. Then, around May, the RBI also gives its dividend to the government and when the government starts spending that money, then liquidity rises even more.\nSo, my sense is we are going to sort of get more comfortable about liquidity being more permanent in nature around from say, middle of April and that is when you will start seeing some positive impact of that.\nIn terms of your question on rates, to be honest, I do think that we could have a slightly deeper rate cutting cycle than what we have been thinking all this time. As RBI cut rates in February, we are expecting a rate cut in April. Maybe they take a break for one or two meetings after that. But it is quite possible that they cut again towards the end of 2025. In fact, our house view is for Fed rate cuts sort of in the second half of the year.\nSo, around that time, if the Fed is cutting, many emerging markets are cutting, India may cut once again but a lot of it depends on how the summer will pan out for us, how will the food prices be? But if all things go well, we could actually see overall easing of say up to 100 basis points in this cycle.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

With falling stock, restoring stability is crucial.\nIndusInd Bank shares fell nearly 6% on Monday (March 10, 2025) to their lowest level since July 2022.\nThe sharp fall came in the wake of two major developments—the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approving Sumant Kathpalia’s reappointment as CEO for just one more year instead of the three-year tenure sought by the bank, and reports that Nippon Life Insurance Co.’s India unit, Reliance Nippon Life Insurance, is considering acquiring a minority stake in the lender.\nInvestors appeared to be reacting with uncertainty, as the regulatory decision hinted at lingering governance concerns, while the potential stake sale raised questions about the bank’s capital requirements and long-term strategy.\nOnce celebrated for its aggressive growth strategies and robust financial performance, IndusInd Bank now faces a critical test of resilience. It must address pressing concerns over asset quality, declining margins, and a falling stock price, all while balancing growth ambitions with the need for stability.\nWith investor confidence shaken and regulatory overhangs casting uncertainty, the bank’s next moves will determine whether it can emerge stronger—or continue to struggle under financial and operational stress.\nAlso read: IndusInd Bank shares plunge as RBI trims CEO extension. Can the stock's lower valuation help?\nKathpalia’s leadership\nSumant Kathpalia, with over 37 years of banking experience, has led IndusInd Bank since March 2020, overseeing its digital expansion and corporate loan growth. However, the RBI’s decision to grant only a one-year extension instead of the three-year term requested signals ongoing regulatory caution over governance and stability.\nThis is not the first time the RBI has limited his tenure. In 2023, a similar request for a three-year extension resulted in just two years. Such decisions suggest a watchful approach from regulators regarding the bank’s strategic execution. As Kathpalia continues at the helm, his focus on asset quality improvement and investor confidence restoration will be crucial.\nStock market woes\nIndusInd Bank’s stock has been on a prolonged decline, falling over 34% in the last six months and significantly underperforming its peers in the banking sector. The downward trend continued on March 7, with shares closing at ₹936.80, just a few points away from its 52-week low of ₹923.40 recorded in January 2025.\nMarket analysts point to a combination of factors driving the stock’s slide. Weak quarterly results, rising NPAs, and regulatory scrutiny have dented investor sentiment. Additionally, a recent bulk sale of 50.8 lakh shares by Integrated Core Strategies (Asia) Pte further pressured the stock. The decline has led to a divergence in investor opinion—while some believe the stock presents a buying opportunity at lower levels, others recommend exiting due to near-term uncertainties.\nAlso read: Ghost of microfinance comes back to haunt IndusInd Bank\nTechnical indicators suggest a bearish outlook. The stock is trading below all major exponential moving averages (EMAs), and its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is hovering near 32.84, signalling oversold territory. Analysts caution that if the stock breaches the ₹910–900 support zone, it could face further downside pressure. Conversely, a breakout above ₹1,000–1,050 could trigger some recovery.\nA deteriorating bottom line\nThe bank’s Q3 FY25 financial results have intensified concerns. IndusInd reported a 39% year-on-year decline in net profit, with earnings dropping to ₹1,402 crore from ₹2,301 crore a year earlier. The sharp fall in profitability was driven by higher provisions and lower net interest income (NII).\nGross NPAs rose to 2.25% of total advances, compared to 2.11% in the previous quarter. The bank’s microfinance loan book, a major contributor to its financial stress, saw NPAs climb to ₹2,432 crore. Net NPAs also inched up, reflecting deteriorating asset quality.\nNII, a key measure of a bank’s core earnings, declined by 1.3% year-on-year, reaching ₹5,228 crore. Net Interest Margins (NIMs) contracted to 3.93%, down from 4.08% in the previous quarter, as the bank struggled with higher funding costs and a shift in its loan mix.\nAlso read: A bank CEO aspirant, his alleged misconduct and RBI deputy guv’s recommendation\nBrokerages have responded by lowering their targets on IndusInd. Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to ‘Neutral,’ while ICICI Securities and Motilal Oswal revised their price targets downward, citing concerns over asset quality and slower-than-expected growth.\nNippon's strategic bet\nAmidst its financial challenges, IndusInd Bank has attracted interest from Nippon Life Insurance Co.’s India unit, Reliance Nippon Life Insurance, is considering acquiring a minority stake of up to 9.9%. If the deal materializes, it could provide the bank with a much-needed capital infusion and pave the way for a deeper bancassurance partnership.\nThe potential investment is particularly noteworthy as IndusInd’s parent company, IndusInd International Holdings Ltd (IIHL), has been restructuring its financial services portfolio. IIHL recently acquired Reliance Capital, a move that aligns with its broader ambitions in the financial services sector. A tie-up with Nippon Life could open new avenues for cross-selling financial products through IndusInd’s extensive branch network.\nWhile the deal is still in the early stages, its success could boost investor sentiment and provide stability in the face of market volatility.\nRegulatory and compliance hurdles\nAdding to IndusInd Bank’s woes, regulatory concerns have emerged. The RBI recently imposed a penalty of ₹27.3 lakh for non-compliance with deposit-related norms. The bank has also received a ₹21.62 crore GST demand notice, which it may challenge in court.\nRegulatory interventions, while not uncommon in the banking sector, raise red flags about operational discipline. The RBI’s repeated decisions to extend Kathpalia’s tenure in short increments further suggest that the bank remains under scrutiny.\nGrowth vs. stability\nIndusInd Bank faces a delicate balancing act. While its corporate loan book has grown 16.1% year-on-year and vehicle financing remains strong, stress in the microfinance segment continues to weigh heavily. The bank has been diversifying its portfolio to reduce reliance on unsecured loans, but the transition will take time.\nOne of the key focus areas for IndusInd Bank is stabilizing its microfinance NPAs, which have been a major source of stress on its financial health. Ensuring recovery in this segment will be critical for restoring investor confidence and mitigating future losses.\nAnother pressing issue is deposit mobilization. The bank’s declining CASA ratio suggests difficulties in attracting low-cost deposits, which are essential for maintaining profitability and improving its funding mix. Addressing this concern will require a strategic push toward strengthening its retail deposit base.\nOperational efficiency is also a major area of concern. Rising costs and higher provisions have put pressure on the bank’s margins. Streamlining expenses, improving productivity, and enhancing digital banking services could be crucial in managing costs effectively.\nAlso read: Cooperative bank crisis: Has anything changed since PMC's plight in 2019?\nLastly, regulatory clarity remains a significant factor. With governance concerns under RBI’s scrutiny, the bank must focus on strengthening its compliance framework and addressing any gaps that may hinder the approval of longer leadership tenures or impact investor sentiment.\nThe road ahead\nIndusInd Bank stands at a crossroads. While challenges remain, opportunities for recovery exist if strategic adjustments are made swiftly. The coming quarters will determine whether the bank can regain its growth momentum or remain mired in financial struggles.\nAs Sumant Kathpalia embarks on another year as CEO, his ability to navigate these complexities will be under intense scrutiny. Investors and regulators alike will be watching closely to see if IndusInd Bank can turn its fortunes around or continue to grapple with uncertainty in India’s competitive banking landscape.\nAbout the author: Suchitra Mandal is a proficient financial writer with expertise in delivering well-researched insights and detailed analyses of companies' performance and market trends.\nDisclosure: The author does not hold any shares of Indusind Bank at the time of writing this article.

The company's shares dropped 21.67 per cent on the National Stock Exchange (NSE), touching a 52-week low of Rs 705.35 apiece.

This has sparked worries about corporate governance and future earnings clarity. IndusInd Bank issued a statement stating that its profitability and capital adequacy levels remain robust enough to withstand this singular impact.\nThe sharp decline in share price followed the bank's disclosure on Monday evening regarding valuation inconsistencies in internal foreign exchange derivative transactions over a 5-7 year period. The financial impact will be reflected in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, according to an ET report.\nThis revelation coincides with existing investor concerns after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) limited IndusInd Bank's CEO Sumant Kathpalia's extension to one year, despite the board's request for a three-year term.\nAlso Read |\nElon Musk, worldâs richest person, loses $120 billion!

Prior to founding NovaaOne, he was Vic...Show more »\nUnlike many high-profile appointments that spark differing opinions among stakeholders and market experts, the appointment of Shri Tuhin Kanta Pandey as the new SEBI Chairman has been met with unanimous approval. His appointment represents a significant milestone, as he is the first serving Finance Secretary to be appointed to this prestigious role. This reflects the government’s strong commitment to ensuring that the financial markets are led by individuals with the right expertise and experience. Shri Pandey brings with him valuable experience from both sides of the regulatory equation—having served as a regulator as former Secretary of Finance and as a \"regulatee\" in his role as the former Secretary of the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM).\nThis appointment speaks volumes about the government’s transparent and unbiased selection process for key positions. It demonstrates a clear determination to place the right person in the right role, which enhances my respect for the government’s decision-making framework.\nGiven the dynamic and often volatile nature of the global financial markets, there has never been a greater need for a leader with a deep understanding of capital markets. The world is facing an unprecedented global crisis, and geopolitical issues of extraordinary magnitude are affecting economies worldwide. In such times, strong leadership at the helm of SEBI is more critical than ever.\nIt’s also noteworthy that Shri Pandey’s appointment follows closely after the presentation of the 2025 Union Budget, where he played a key role in budget preparation as Secretary of Finance. The Union Budget and the Economic Survey of 2025 signal a call for deregulation and trust-based governance, themes that align closely with the government’s economic vision.\nThe 2025 Budget and Economic Survey: A Call for Deregulation and Trust-Based Governance\nThe 2025 Union Budget underscores the need for regulatory reform by advocating for a “light-touch regulatory framework based on principles and trust to unleash productivity and employment.” This approach is not merely about changing regulations; it represents a crucial step toward unlocking India’s full economic potential.\nThe urgency for deregulation has never been greater. The Economic Survey of 2025 stresses the need to “get out of the way and trust the people, for we have no other choice.” This marks a paradigm shift in governance, reminiscent of the 1991 Budget, which laid the foundation for India’s economic liberalization. The Economic Survey rightly points out that deregulation plays a crucial role in enhancing investment efficiency. By eliminating unnecessary barriers, streamlining regulations, and improving the ease of doing business, India can create a more favorable environment for business growth. The Survey also emphasizes that deregulation will foster a positive sentiment, build trust in governance, and improve compliance by transforming the relationship between the governed and the governing into a true partnership.\nAs the Bhagavad Gita (Chapter 3, Verse 26) states:\n“A great leader inspires others to do their right duties.”\n“na buddhi-bhedaṁ janayed ajñānāṁ karma-saṅginām\njoṣhayet sarva-karmāṇi vidvān yuktaḥ samācharan”\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

Despite near-term pressures, India’s structural economic growth, policy stability, and favorable demographics remain intact, making it a preferred bet for long-term investors.\nWhile China is gaining attention as a tactical trade, India remains the most compelling structural story in Asia.\nHere’s how these experts weigh in on India’s market trajectory:\nChristopher Wood: India’s correction is technical, not structural\nChristopher Wood, Global Head of Equity Strategy at Jefferies, acknowledged the recent market downturn but emphasized that it was largely driven by technical factors rather than any fundamental macroeconomic weakness.\nSpeaking to ET Now, he stated, \"This correction is primarily driven by technical factors in terms of compression of valuations, most particularly in the midcap area, it is not driven by any major macroeconomic problem.\"\nWood highlighted that the supply of equity caught up with demand, especially in the midcap space, as Indian corporates took advantage of high valuations to raise capital. Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) liquidity tightening measures contributed to the correction.\nDespite the decline, Wood reiterated his bullish long-term stance on India, saying, \"I still believe India is the best structural story in Asia and in fact globally.\" He also pointed out that while foreign selling had already been large, India had corrected before US markets started showing weakness, which could cushion further downside risks.\nAlso read: Booster shot to Indian defence sector from European Commission’s ReArm plan: HAL, BEL among 6 stocks to buy\nVivek Paul: Foreign investors still favor largecaps in India\nVivek Paul, Senior Portfolio Strategist at BlackRock, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing that India's structural opportunities remain intact. \"If we were thinking for anybody with an investing horizon 5, 10 years out, we would be building portfolios today...where you would hold a greater allocation than a benchmark weight,\" he stated in his ET Now interview.\nWhile he acknowledged cyclical challenges such as global uncertainty, liquidity constraints, and consumption slowdown, he argued that valuations in Indian largecaps are not as expensive as they seem when factoring in future earnings growth. \"If I were to try and think, well, what are earnings going to be in the future?\" he asked, suggesting that forward-looking valuations make Indian equities attractive.\nPaul also noted that India remains a stock picker’s market, stating that \"this is a case where momentum can be now measured in hours rather than days and weeks.\" This high volatility presents both risks and opportunities, particularly in financials and discretionary consumption stocks, which are seeing a shift in domestic portfolios post-budget.\nJim Walker: India offers policy stability and growth potential\nJim Walker, Chief Economist at Asianomics, took a more macroeconomic view, highlighting India’s policy stability and government-led economic reforms. In his discussion with ET Now, he asserted, \"India looks better to me now than at any time in the last 30 years in terms of policy stability and policy certainty.\"\nWalker pointed out that India’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain strong, unlike the US, where excessive fiscal deficits and tariff-driven uncertainties pose risks. He stated, \"The real problems lie in the advanced economies in America...while money is flowing back into America, I think that is a bad move.\"\nHe also advised long-term investors to double down on India, emphasizing that while concerns over valuations exist, earnings growth will soon support current price levels. \"My view is that economic growth is going to take off from here and those valuations will be very quickly supported by corporate earnings,\" he concluded.\nConclusion: A short-term correction, a long-term opportunity\nWhile Indian equities have experienced a sharp correction, leading analysts agree that this is a mid-cycle adjustment rather than a prolonged downturn. Factors like a weaker US dollar, RBI’s potential easing measures, and government-led economic reforms provide significant upside potential for long-term investors.\nWith largecaps now offering a favorable risk-reward ratio, investors looking beyond short-term volatility may find this correction as the perfect entry point into India’s growth story. As Jim Walker aptly put it, \"This is the time to absolutely double down on India.\"\nAlso read: Expect a tumultuous market for rest of this month and first few days of April: Deepak Shenoy\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Whoever wants to call this country by whatever name, he can call it,\" he said.\n\"We call it Indian Air Force, Indian Army and also sing 'Sare jahan se achha Hindustan humara'..,.\" he added.\nMeanwhile, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi called it an effort to distract attention from \"main issues of the country.\" \"The kind of comments coming from the RSS... few days back, their chief had also said something... what are the main issues of the country?

Speaking at the launch of the book Vimarsh Bharat Ka, published by Suruchi Prakashan, at the Panchsheel Balak Inter College auditorium, Hosabale emphasised the need to embrace Bharat’s identity over India. The event was organised by Prerna Shodh Sansthan Nyas, an RSS-inspired organisation.\n“Desh ka naam Bharat hai, toh Bharat hi Bolo. India toh angrezi naam hai,\" he said, pointing out contradictions such as the Constitution of India and Reserve Bank of India still carrying the “colonial\" name.\nFrom India to Bharat\nUrging citizens to question this duality, referencing how the G20 dinner hosted by PM Modi at the Rashtrapati Bhavan mentioned the country as the ‘Republic of Bharat’ in the invitation card.\nHosabale linked the issue to a broader need for ‘decolonisation of mind’, arguing that British rule left a deep imprint that still continues to shape Indian consciousness. He cited historical instances of cultural erasure, from the destruction of temples and gurukuls during the invasion by the Mughals to the imposition of English as a dominant language.\n“Mughals invaded Bharat, destroyed our temples, gurukuls, ancient culture, dominated us, but it did not make us feel inferior to the extent the British did. British rule made us feel that they were better than us. The idea of ‘Engraziyat’ still persists. That is why the business of English medium schools flourishes here,\" he said, calling for a shift from colonial-era mindsets.\nHe also dismissed Left-liberal historical narratives as ‘misleading’, accusing them of portraying Bharat’s past rulers as oppressors. “They want us to believe that all our kings were oppressors. They made that narrative, which was misleading.\"\nHosabale invoked VS Naipaul’s critiques of post-colonial societies, emphasising the need for an intellectual reset. “A new wave must sweep across the nation, one that does not diminish others or demean other nations but reclaims our own identity,\" he said. “Bharat will never stand for Dadagiri (one up-manship), or to destroy other countries. Bharat will always stand for global good. But, before that, we have to stay united and lead by example,\" he added.\nHosabale’s comments signal an intensified push by the RSS to popularise ‘Bharat’ over India, a campaign that has gained traction in political and cultural discourse.\nNews18 had earlier reported on government-initiated efforts to make ‘Bharat’ appear on official documents more than before. Starting from G20 documents to naming new programmes and also naming the new penal code, the government used ‘Bharat’ or ‘Bhartiya’ in place of ‘India’ or ‘Indian’. However, senior officers said there would not be any retrospective effect.", "text_len": 3572}

The impact will be recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. This development comes amid broader investor unease after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) granted CEO Sumant Kathpalia only a one-year extension instead of the three-year term sought by the board.\nHere’s what brokerages are saying about IndusInd Bank:\nEmkay Global:\nEmkay Global downgraded IndusInd Bank to 'Add' from 'Buy' and slashed its target price by 22% to Rs 875, citing the forex derivative loss and the uncertainty surrounding the final external audit report due in Q4FY25.\n“This follows IIB hosting an analyst call on 10-Mar-25 to discuss the impact of significant accounting discrepancies observed in its forex derivatives portfolio, which is expected to have an adverse impact of 2.35% on its net worth as of Dec-24 (post-tax: ~Rs 15.8bn). This is based on preliminary findings, and the final impact may vary following the completion of the external audit in Q4FY25,” the brokerage said.\nNuvama:\nNuvama downgraded IndusInd Bank to 'Reduce' from 'Hold' and cut its target price to Rs 750, citing credibility concerns following multiple negative developments, including the CFO’s resignation, the CEO’s short tenure extension, and now the forex derivative markdown. The brokerage expects continued earnings pressure.\n“A negative derivatives disclosure has the potential to unnerve investors more than a backdated NPL disclosure. The CEO explained the Board would consider internal and external candidates as part of succession planning. Given low visibility on succession and earnings (MFI stress, derivatives, and change of guard), we are downgrading the stock,” the brokerage said.\nMotilal Oswal:\nMotilal Oswal downgraded IndusInd Bank to ‘Neutral’ with a revised target price of Rs 925, down from an earlier estimate. The brokerage noted that the bank's accounting discrepancies will weigh on near-term performance but believes the management's succession planning and the resolution of governance concerns could support a recovery.\n“The recent accounting discrepancies related to derivative transactions have further dampened sentiments and are likely to drive losses in 4QFY25 as the bank absorbs the impact through its P&L. We expect the stock to react negatively to this development. However, we believe the board will expedite the process of evaluating both internal and external candidates for a suitable successor, which should help alleviate concerns and improve confidence in the bank’s operations,” the brokerage said.\nWhat should investors do?\nWith the stock already down 47% in the past year and facing a fresh 20% drop on Tuesday, some brokerages see a modest upside from current levels, while credibility concerns and weak earnings visibility remain key headwinds.\nAnalysts caution that any recovery will depend on the outcome of the external audit, succession planning, and the bank’s ability to reassure investors about its governance standards.\nAlso Read: Stocks in news: City Union Bank, Navin Fluorine, Syngene, IIFL Finance, NLC India, Sharda Cropchem and Arvind Fashions\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Banking liquidity in India suffered its highest deficit in at least 14 years earlier this year and overnight borrowing costs jumped. Liquidity also dried up in Indonesia and Malaysia following central bank currency interventions.\nThese moves are explained by what economists call the impossible trinity, the idea that countries can't simultaneously control their currencies, independently set interest rates and allow capital to move freely across borders. Something will break or give way.\n\"Under the impossible trinity, if a central bank opts to hold the currency stable and one assumes an unchanged capital account regime, rates have to be the adjustment mechanism. That will emerge initially in interbank money market rates,\" said Philip McNicholas, an Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco.\nRising interbank rates are a sign of a cash shortage that could hit the wider economy, discouraging banks from lending and potentially crimping economic growth.\nThe impossible trinity underscores the complicated questions facing investors in emerging markets. Currency depreciation hits the value of the stocks and bonds foreign investors hold in these countries, but if stability comes at a cost to economic growth, the whole investment case can be undermined.\nOne central bank is starting to push back against the side effects of defending its currency. The Reserve Bank of India said on March 5 that it would inject $21.5 billion into the financial system through a mix of bond purchases and swap auctions before the March 31 year-end, its latest attempt to offset the cash crunch.\nThe People's Bank of China has so far held back from a similar round of big liquidity injections, keeping its focus on the currency. Although there were some hopes the tide was turning after the government unveiled an economic growth target of around 5%, an ambitious goal that will require looser monetary conditions, bond yields once again spiked on Friday.\nTraders are now braced for a period of uncertainty in a year likely to be defined by US President Donald Trump's swashbuckling approach to global trade. Central banks may be forced to play whack-a-mole: defending their currencies one day, and easing liquidity strains the next.\n\"The currency volatility could continue amid ongoing global trade and tariff wars and will imply emerging market central banks, including the RBI, will have to be on their toes on the FX front,\" said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services in Mumbai.\nThe rupee is likely to weaken to 89.50 per dollar by the end of the year, said Arora, a move of more than 3% from Friday's levels. Bank Indonesia has taken a novel approach to defending its currency, launching a new type of rupiah-denominated bill in September 2023 designed to attract capital inflows.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

In its latest report on âIndia Equity Strategy and Economicsâ, Morgan Stanley says that Indiaâs long-term story remains intact, adding that its sentiment indicator is in âstrong buy territoryâ for Indian equities.\nâA likely positive shift in fundamentals is not in the price â we expect India to recover lost ground against its peer group through the rest of 2025,â says Ridham Desai, Equity Strategist at Morgan Stanley.\nMorgan Stanley maintains its Sensex projection of 105,000 points for December 2025. The financial institution's team of strategists and economists, under Ridham Desai, observed that India's comparative earnings growth is showing an upward trend, even when considering conservative consensus estimates. They have characterised India as 'A stock pickers' market'.\nSectors in Focus\nAccording to the report, India's earnings projections surpass market consensus expectations. The countryâs comparative earnings trajectory shows an upward trend, even when considering cautious consensus predictions. Current valuations stand at their most favourable levels since the Covid pandemic period, it says.\nStocks in Focus\nâThe market has ignored the RBI's policy pivot, and a strong budget from the government, among other positive developments since early February.\nIndia's low beta characteristic make it an ideal market for the uncertain macro environment that equities are dealing with. Importantly, our sentiment indicator is in strong buy territory,â the report says.\nWhy Morgan Stanley is positive about India\n- The GDP figures for quarter ending Dec-24 confirm the recovery trajectory, following the lowest point in quarter ending Sep-24. The outlook suggests a widespread consumption recovery, with urban demand set to increase due to income tax reductions, complementing the strong rural consumption patterns. Despite global economic uncertainties and geopolitical challenges, Morgan Stanley anticipates GDP growth of 6.3% YoY in F2025, followed by 6.5% in F2026-27.\nReal GDP Growth Projection\n- The headline CPI has declined to approximately 4% from its recent peak, influenced by declining food prices, whilst core inflation remains stable. Food prices, comprising ~46% of the CPI basket, are expected to decrease further, influencing the overall inflation outlook. The report projects inflation will reach ~4.3% YoY in F2026-27, down from 4.9% YoY in F2025.\n- The RBI has initiated comprehensive easing measures across rates, liquidity and regulations. Following the repo rate reduction in February's policy meeting, Morgan Stanley anticipates an additional 25 bps cut during the April policy session in this easing cycle.\nFurther repo rate cuts expected\n- The Budget focuses on strengthening economic recovery through consumption stimulus via income tax reductions and increased capital expenditure allocation, whilst maintaining fiscal discipline to ensure macroeconomic stability.\nIndian Stock Markets Show Signs of Being Oversold - Top 10 Factors\nIndia is anticipated to regain its position relative to Emerging Markets in 2025, supported by several fundamental factors. These include robust macro stability with better terms of trade, reducing primary deficit and stabilising inflation; consistent annual earnings growth of 15-19% over the coming 3-5 years, driven by private capital expenditure, corporate balance sheet expansion and increased discretionary spending; alongside reliable domestic risk capital.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, the equity market continues to overlook good news (as it always does when its psychology is bad): There have been some good developments over the past five weeks which include:\n1) A budget focused on capital expenditure that progressively reduces the primary deficit. The government has managed this equilibrium through reduced subsidy spending, which should help control inflation. The decreased primary deficit will create space for private sector credit and investment activities.\n2) The Reserve Bank of India's transformation encompasses three aspects: rate reductions, enhanced liquidity provisions and eased regulatory requirements. The RBI's policy decisions could potentially intensify the economic deceleration in 2024. However, it appears probable that credit expansion will improve from current levels, which should boost growth rates compared to the previous two quarters.\n3) Taxation policy changes designed to enhance international capital inflows.

These were applicable from 1 April 2024.\nDiscrepancies pertain to derivatives\nThe discrepancies pertain to derivatives used by the bank as a hedge against foreign currency deposits or borrowings on the balance sheet, which need to be converted to the Indian rupee. The lapses stemmed from a mismatch as similar trades were being accounted for differently, which came to light while unwinding existing positions to comply with the revised RBI norms.\nThe final impact on financials will be decided based on the report of the external agency, Kathpalia said in an analyst call on Monday, adding that it is expected to be “range-bound\" or in line with the internal estimate.\n- IndusInd Bank found ₹1,530 crore worth of discrepancies in its derivatives account balances.\n- These discrepancies represent an estimated 2.35% adverse impact on the bank's net worth.\n- The issue surfaced after implementing revised RBI norms, prompting an internal and external review.\n- The discrepancies involve derivatives used to hedge against foreign currency deposits and borrowings.\n- The lapses stemmed from a mismatch in accounting for similar trades, particularly internal vs. external trades.\nIndusInd Bank also clarified that its treasury department, as per norms, continues to undergo multiple concurrent audits on an ongoing basis. The current issue did not throw up any visible gaps till a few months back, which is when the bank decided to review the situation and “dig deeper\" given also that the discrepancies pertain to a long period of time, new chief financial officer and deputy CEO Arun Khurana said in the call.\nThe bank remains healthy to “absorb this one-time impact\" during the fourth quarter ending March 2025, but the issue could have had a bearing on the central bank’s decision last week to approve his reappointment only for a a year instead of three, Kathpalia said.\n“That’s for the regulator to answer. This could have had a bearing because they were aware of the issue. There was some inkling towards the issue. I don't know what is the rationale for them to give me one year, but if they're uncomfortable with my leadership skills of running the bank, we have to respect that,\" Kathpalia said in the call.\nAlso read | Ghost of microfinance comes back to haunt IndusInd Bank\n“I think this is a litmus test for the bank and from a succession point as to how we take the bank forward,\" he said, adding that he doesn’t believe that regular course of business will be impacted or that the bank’s growth agenda will \"get off the track\".\nThe issue at the bank comes a little over a month after chief financial officer Gobind Jain resigned from his position citing “opportunities\" outside the bank. Kathpalia said while Jain was aware of this transaction, his resignation is not linked to “only to this transaction\". “He had a different narrative on why he was leaving. That has been the case, and we are fine with that.\"\nHe added that the objective of the bank to declare the discrepancies was to disclose the lapses upfront rather than delaying them till after the external evaluation. \"I don't think that is the right way...The amount of the impact is of a material nature, so we thought it's only prudent to come upfront based on our own internal review.\"\nAccounting discrepancies\nThe derivatives or hedging instruments were used by the balance sheet management or asset-liability management desks of the bank against foreign currency deposits or borrowings on the balance sheet which need to be converted to the Indian rupee.\nThe accounting discrepancies pertain to hedging instruments used by the balance sheet management or asset-liability management desks of the bank. The derivatives are used against foreign currency deposits or borrowings on the balance sheet which need to be converted to the Indian rupee.\nThis practice was being followed by the bank’s treasury department since the start of the derivatives desk 5-7 years ago, Khurana explained in the call. The large number came up because there was a process that was always being followed by the bank right from the inception of these transactions for the internal trades that were done by the desk.\nSuch internal trades were done for foreign currency which had liquidity in the external market, such as a 3-5-year yen deposit to be swapped into Indian rupee or an 8-10 year dollar borrowing from a multilateral. The bank used to take market quotes from at least three to four sources before getting into contracts. The issue, Khurana explained, possibly came up when the internal trade was done with the trading desk, and the trading desk in turn went out and hedged the trade itself because of the prescribed risk limits.\nAlso read | For IndusInd Bank, no quick turnaround in sight\n“So external trade was mark-to-market, while the internal trade was on swap cost accounting or swap valuations. These two legs would vary during the period of contract, but converge on maturity,\" he said, adding that if the bank were to unwind the trade in the interim period to repay the borrowings, one of the trades was hitting the bank’s profit and loss whereas the other was hitting the asset book. \"That is where the difference came in. This was the practice that was being followed.\"\nDuring the implementation of RBI’s revised circular, which required discontinuation of internal trades among other measures effective April 2024, the bank unearthed the large difference in account balances in September-October 2024. The bank then conducted the internal review before hiring the external agency.\n“Effective April 1, we can confirm that there will be no internal trades in our book. The internal trades are for the prior period. Those existing on April 1 have been unwound and, accordingly, mark-to-market (MTM) has been taken,\" he said, adding that the bank now only does external trades with market counterparties for hedging the balance sheet in the currency book.\nIn most cases, these hedges were accounted for under interest income. The bank said it is in discussions, likely with the regulator, on how to account for this hit.\n“We are comfortable that by March-end or early April we should be able to identify the gap, and it seems to be in line with what we are saying. But we want to be very sure about it because it is still not validated completely,\" Kathpalia said, adding that the impact will likely have to be taken on the profit and loss account.\n“The bank has enough reserves as well as capital to manage this transition. I wanted to be upfront with you to say that we are in a position where we are seeing some losses coming in, rather than doing it in March-April.\"\nAlso read | RBI may give final nod for stake increase in IndusInd Bank soon: Ashok Hinduja\nThese lapses come at a time when IndusInd Bank is already facing a hit on financials due to stress in the lender’s microfinance (MFI) portfolio, which is expected to hurt asset quality in the current quarter.\nKathpalia said that delinquencies in the MFI portfolio seem to be stabilising and Q4 FY25 should be the “bottom of the pyramid on this\" before asset quality and credit costs start improving Q1 FY26 onwards. He added that despite these accounting lapses, the bank’s overall performance in Q4 FY25 should remain as per guidance and the bank will continue to meet its targets.\n\"Our channel checks seem to suggest that such kind of losses are possible when the book is not fully covered (i.e., there are open positions and unhedged trades) and as per some treasury heads of banks, the new RBI accounting rules cannot solely explain the discrepancy,\" Macquarie Research said in a note.\n“IndusInd Bank has a large market share in NRI (non-resident Indian) deposits and has been offering higher rates to customers. NRI segment deposits at ₹58,600 crore grew by 39% YoY in Q3 FY25 vs overall deposit growth of 11% YoY. The bank's market share in NRI segment stands at 3.9%, more than double its overall market share in deposits at 1.8%,\" Macquarie said, adding that issues like this can create questions on the \"robustness of the bank's internal process and compliance\".\nKhurana had said during his call that IndusInd Bank had no unhedged foreign currency positions.", "text_len": 9709}

Under this ban, no fresh derivatives positions can be created, and only existing positions can be squared off until the positions of participants fall.\nSuch was the sentiment among traders that outstanding trader positions hit 179.5 million shares against the market-wide limit of 120.8 million shares. Even in the cash market, the stock was the most traded, witnessing a volume of ₹6,987 crore.\nThe bargain hunters\nInterestingly, as the share plunged by 27%, there were investors who bought the stock from sellers.

It said an internal review of processes relating to Other Asset and Other Liability accounts of the derivative portfolio found that the bank had underestimated hedging costs related to forex transactions over a five- to seven-year period. The bank had used internal derivative trades against its foreign currency borrowings as well as deposits up to March 31, 2024. The review was in line with the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) circular on valuation and operation of the investment portfolio of commercial banks, including derivatives portfolio management.\nThe potential impact of the discrepancy is estimated to be 2.35% of the net worth of the bank as of December 2024, which comes to about Rs 1500-1600 crore. The bank’s net worth was Rs 65,102 crore as of December 31, 2024.\nWhat was the impact in the markets?\nWith investors worried about corporate governance and future earnings clarity at the bank, shares of IndusInd Bank recorded their steepest decline ever on Tuesday, and ended down 27.2% at Rs 655.95 on the BSE after hitting an intra-day low of Rs 649, the lowest since November 2020. On the NSE, it tumbled 27.06% to Rs 656.80. On Monday also, the shares ended nearly 4% lower after its CEO Sumant Kathpalia got only a one-year extension from the RBI till March 2026, against the three-year term sought by the bank.\nThe IndusInd Bank stock has been falling for the last five consecutive sessions. The stock has experienced a decline of 58% from the 52-week high of Rs 1,576.35 on the NSE on April 8, 2024. Tuesday’s crash has eroded around Rs 19,000 crore worth of market capitalisation for IndusInd Bank.\nThe IndusInd Bank shares fall also dragged down bank indices on Tuesday. Nifty Private Bank index declined 1.38% to 23,817.20 and Nifty Bank index fell 0.75% to 47,853.95.\nWhat are analysts saying?\nThe discrepancies arose from internal trades with low liquidity that were on swap contracts and not marked-to-market, Motilal Oswal Financial Services said in a note, indicating the trades were to do with 3/5-year yen and 8/10-year dollar borrowings. Until new investment norms kicked in from April 1, 2024, banks’ asset liability management (ALM) and treasury desks could do internal swaps, where typically one cash flow is exchanged for another.\n“When currencies became volatile and the dollar strengthened, the treasury department booked these gains,” Reuters quoted a senior analyst as saying. “The bank should have reported the loss that the ALM desk faced due to the swap, but that was not done. Whether that was deliberate or a systemic goof up is yet to be determined,” the person told Reuters.\nDomestic brokerage Nuvama also expressed concern over the delayed disclosure. “The bank said that they wanted to give out a best-case estimate of the impact; hence, it was not disclosed during the Q3FY25 earnings call,” it said.\nWhat will the bank do now?\nIndusInd Bank has already appointed an external agency to independently review and validate the internal findings. A final report of the external agency is awaited, based on which the potential impact may need to be revised. Media reports say PwC is most probably the external agency doing the review. The loss will be likely accounted for in the March, 2025 quarter or June quarter of FY 26. The bank has said that its profitability and capital adequacy are strong enough to absorb the one-time impact.\nThe promoter of the bank, Ashoka Hinduja, also assured investors that the bank’s financials remain healthy, and the promoters would inject capital if any capital requirement arose. “Shareholders shouldn’t panic. These are normal routine problems. I under-stand their concern is over why they were not informed earlier. Banking businesses are based on integrity and trust,” he told CNBC-TV18, emphasis-ing that it was the bank which had brought the issue to attention.\nWill worse follow?\nMultiple brokerages have downgraded the IndusInd Bank stock and reduced price targets. Pointing out that the bank’s estimates of the adverse impact is post tax, ICICI Securities said the pre-tax hit would be higher at Rs 2,000-2,100 crore. “The hit is likely to run through P&L, and the bank could even report a loss in Q4FY25,” it said. This would hit overall earnings by 25%.\nThe inherent risks in banking make picking a bank stock difficult. In recent years, Yes Bank, RBL Bank, Bandhan Bank have all faced their share of trouble. As Devina Mehra, founder & CMD of First Global, wrote in her LinkedIn post, it is in the structure of the business where negative surprises outweigh positive surprises. “This is one business where higher than expected growth may not be a good thing at all except that you come to know of the problems created only some years later,” she said.\nThe key question now is whether this is a one-off event or the start of something bigger.", "text_len": 5024}

The Reserve Bank of India said on March 5 that it would inject $21.5 billion into the financial system through a mix of bond purchases and swap auctions before the March 31 year-end, its latest attempt to offset the cash crunch.\nThe People’s Bank of China has so far held back from a similar round of big liquidity injections, keeping its focus on the currency. Although there were some hopes the tide was turning after the government unveiled an economic growth target of around 5%, an ambitious goal that will require looser monetary conditions, bond yields once again spiked on Friday.\nTraders are now braced for a period of uncertainty in a year likely to be defined by US President Donald Trump’s swashbuckling approach to global trade. Central banks may be forced to play whack-a-mole: defending their currencies one day, and easing liquidity strains the next.\n“The currency volatility could continue amid ongoing global trade and tariff wars and will imply emerging market central banks, including the RBI, will have to be on their toes on the FX front,” said Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai.\nThe rupee is likely to weaken to 89.50 per dollar by the end of the year, said Arora, a move of more than 3% from Friday’s levels.\nBank Indonesia has taken a novel approach to defending its currency, launching a new type of rupiah-denominated bill in September 2023 designed to attract capital inflows. But the securities have lured funds away from the banking system, and may have contributed to tightening liquidity, wrote Goldman Sachs strategists including Rina Jio and Danny Suwanapruti in a note on Feb. 26.\nBank Negara Malaysia has leaned on currency forwards to support the ringgit, swelling its net short forward book. That has combined with high loan-to-deposit ratios to tighten interbank liquidity, said Robeco’s McNicholas.\nThere is an irony to the pain being felt by central banks pushing back against a strong dollar. Stephen Miran, Trump’s pick as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, has written extensively about the costs to the US of a strong dollar — and traders have recently obsessed over the potential for a ‘Mar-a-Lago Accord’ that could lead to a prolonged period of dollar weakness.\nThat may not sound like such a bad idea to central bankers in Asia, who have increasingly been forced to confront their own costs from dollar strength.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 4324}

A fall in the dollar index also boosted investor sentiment towards emerging markets, while the US equity markets have declined due to uncertainty over Trump's economic policies,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.\nThis week will be a truncated one, as markets will remain closed on Friday due to the Holi festival holiday. This may lead to increased volatility as traders adjust their positions ahead of the break.\nAs investors look ahead, several key factors will influence the market’s direction in the coming week:\n1) Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) Activity\nSo far this month, foreigners have sold equities worth nearly Rs 25,000 crore, bringing the total equity selling in 2025 to Rs 137,354 crore.“There is significant buying in Chinese stocks, triggered by attractive valuations and expectations from the recent positive initiatives by the Chinese government towards their large businesses. The rally in Chinese stocks has resulted in the Hang Seng Index performing exceedingly well, with a YTD return of 23.48%, compared to a -5% YTD return in the Nifty. However, this is more likely to be a short-term cyclical trade since Chinese corporate earnings have continuously disappointed since 2008,” said Dr. V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.\nAny increased selling pressure from FIIs could weigh on sentiment, while inflows could give more momentum to the relief rally seen last week.\nAlso read | Tired of buying the dip? 3 survival strategies for investors trapped in bear market\n2) Dollar Index\nThe recent decline in the dollar index to 104 is seen as a positive sign for emerging markets, including India. A weaker dollar typically supports risk assets and enhances foreign inflows into equities. Market participants will closely monitor further movements in the dollar index.3) Bond Yields\nUS 10-year Treasury yields have dropped to 4.2%, offering relief to global equities. Lower bond yields reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income assets compared to equities, which may lead to increased risk-taking by investors in stock markets.4) Crude Oil Prices\nBrent crude oil prices have hit a six-month low following OPEC+’s decision to increase production and persistent growth concerns in the U.S. A decline in crude prices is beneficial for India, a major oil importer, as it helps curb inflation and improves corporate profit margins, particularly for energy-intensive industries.For the week, Brent was down 3.8%, marking its biggest weekly decline since the week of November 11.\n5) Macro Data Releases and Tariff Concerns\nDomestic and global macroeconomic indicators will be closely monitored this week. In India, the release of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will provide insights into economic momentum. Additionally, investors will track U.S. inflation data, non-farm payroll figures, and developments on U.S. trade tariffs, all of which could impact global market sentiment.Also read | Trump tariff threat: What it means for stock market investors in India\n6) Technical Indicators\nTechnical analysts suggest that the Nifty is likely to extend its pullback rally in the coming sessions.\"The zone of 22,670-22,700 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index as it is the confluence of the 20-day EMA and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of its recent downward journey (23,807-21,965). If the index sustains above the 22,700 level, we may witness an extension of the pullback rally up to the 23,000 level, followed by the 23,300 level in the short term,” said SBI Securities.\nOn the downside, the zone of 22,300-22,250 is likely to provide support in case of any immediate decline.\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views, and opinions given by experts are their own.

It assessed the bank's \"Other Asset and Other Liability\" accounts and detected inconsistencies in account balances.\n\"The bank's detailed internal review has estimated an adverse impact of approximately 2.35% of the Bank’s Net worth as of December 2024. The Bank has also, in parallel, appointed a reputed external agency to independently review and validate the internal findings. A final report of the external agency is awaited and basis which the Bank will appropriately consider any resultant impact in its financial statements,\" IndusInd Bank said in its filing.\nThe bank said that its profitability and capital adequacy remain healthy to absorb this one-time impact, however, this development resulted in concerns about IndusInd Bank’s credibility.\nThis was followed by various downgrades across brokerage firms. Here’s what analysts said:\nElara Capital: Sell| Target price: Rs 830\nElara Capital downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ from ‘accumulate’ with a target price of Rs 830, down from Rs 1,020.\nElara Capital stated that the recent development has raised concerns, especially given the lower-than-expected tenure extension of MD & CEO Sumant Kathpalia and the recent CFO exit. The timing of this disclosure is questionable, leaving key questions unanswered: Why was this not flagged earlier? How did it escape concurrent audits? Why did auditors not highlight it? Are there further risks? How did this remain undetected for over five years? These concerns challenge the credibility of processes and book value sanctity.\nAlso read: IndusInd & Out: Rs 19,000 crore lost in a day\nKotak Equities: Reduce| Target price: Rs 850\nKotak Institutional Equities has downgraded the stock to a ‘reduce’ rating from an earlier ‘buy’ with a reduced target price of Rs 850, down from Rs 1,400.\nIn a relatively surprising and disappointing development, the bank notified the exchanges of a preliminary impact of 2.4% of its net worth due to a change in the valuation of derivatives transactions. The bank would book this impact in 4QFY25. Although the financial implications are negligible, it raises the broader issue of credibility.\nICICI Securities: Reduce| Target price: Rs 850\nICICI Securities maintained its ‘reduce’ call on IndusInd Bank with a target price of Rs 850.\nICICI Securities pegs the pre-tax hit at Rs 20bn–21bn with the recent hit of 2.35% on its net worth. The bank mentioned that these derivative positions pertain to foreign currency deposits/borrowings conversion and not to any client/industry exposure. Since 1 Apr’24, the bank has stopped internal hedging, post which, around Sep’24, it identified the discrepancies. The hit is likely to be routed through P&L in Q4FY25, which in the brokerage firm’s view, could severely dent reported profitability; may even report a loss in Q4FY25. ICICI Securities further believes the discrepancies reflect poorly on internal control.\nEmkay Global: Add| Target price: Rs 875\nEmkay Global downgraded IndusInd Bank to ‘add’ from ‘buy’ and slashed its target price by 22% to Rs 875, citing the forex derivative loss and the uncertainty surrounding the final external audit report due in Q4FY25.\n“This follows IIB hosting an analyst call on 10-Mar-25 to discuss the impact of huge accounting discrepancies observed in its forex derivatives portfolio which is expected to have an adverse impact of 2.35% on its net worth as of Dec-24 (post-tax: ~Rs15.8bn). This is based on preliminary findings, and the final impact may vary following completion of the external audit in Q4FY25,” the brokerage said.\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

Binance, KuCoin and now Coinbase entering the country may corner a significant market share, but the domestic players don’t seem worried. Exchanges such as CoinSwitch, CoinDCX and Mudrex said more competition will only improve the quality of services and products.\nCoinbase, with a market cap of nearly $50 billion on Nasdaq, is eyeing its comeback to India with its crypto trading services later this year. During its previous short stint in the country, the exchange had run into troubles with the banking regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and UPI.\nAshish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch told Moneycontrol, “India, the world’s fastest-growing major economy, is home to an expanding base of retail and institutional investors. This presents a significant opportunity for global financial firms—especially in crypto, where interest is growing.”\n“More competition, more products, lead to better products serving users. This is great for the crypto industry in India. That said, we believe India’s financial ecosystem operates within a distinct regulatory framework, evolving tax policies and frequent consumer facing challenges,” he added.\nWhile the crypto market in India is still very nascent and lacks regulations, US President Donald Trump pro-crypto policies have started to shift sentiments, especially towards India, which accounts for nearly 11.8 percent of the world’s crypto developers.\nLast week, speaking at Moneycontrol Global Summit, Sumit Gupta, Co-founder, CoinDCX said that not only will Indian crypto exchanges survive but also win as the intensifying competition from global peers would “create the market.”\nGupta said, “Let them set the field. But eventually, Indian domestic players 5-10 years down the line will have a dominant role to play in the system. I do believe that it's going to be a heavily regulated industry, eventually. And when regulations are there, then it's not easy to operate. Only the long-term seriously committed players essentially win the market.”\n“If you look at the financial sector, which foreign company in India has been able to have a significant market presence? None. None of the foreign banks have survived in India. None of the fintech players like Revolut have been able to gain a significant presence in India. The only exception is a company like Google Pay which has some presence and that too because of a lot of India angle,” he added.\n“What it takes to go from a small market to becoming a very large market is more players coming in and they come in when there is more clarity and that's exactly what we're seeing,” Edul Patel, Co-founder of Mudrex said.\nDisrupting domestic exchanges\nAnalysts, however, have unanimously said that domestic exchanges would be on the backfoot with global players getting registered with the Financial Intelligence Unit – India. It would kill the domestic players, they said.\nSidharth Sogani, Founder of CREBACO, a crypto research firm and CEO of Blue Aster Capital, a crypto hedge fund said, “It is good that a large player like Coinbase is entering India. It will bring more liquidity into the market… India will be a very interesting market. Once we have a regulator, India will be a good market.”\n“Most domestic exchanges source their crypto from overseas and have to pay a premium and also they keep a higher profit margin while selling crypto to Indian users. International larger exchanges like Coinbase reduce this cost, and make crypto cheaper for Indian users, as they have their own reserves,” he added. Sogani shared that most crypto tokens are trading at a 3-5 percent premium on Indian exchanges as compared to the global ones.\nKashif Raza, founder of Bitinning, believes the Indian exchanges still lack a level playing field against global counterparts amid lack of regulatory frameworks.\n“FIU registration is just a starting point. In the interest of foreign exchanges and Indian exchanges, it would have been great to give clarity to foreign exchanges to set up offices in India after registering and provide them more clarity on taxation, GST and TDS,” he said.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

This was based on a collection of suspicious transaction reports (STRs) from the sector, along with the findings from their \"operational analysis.\"\nHowever, the report clarified that these trends are based on \"suspicion\" and carry potential financial and national security risks.\nAccording to the report accessed by PTI, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has shared these trends, along with \"credible\" intelligence regarding cryptocurrency operations in India, with relevant law enforcement agencies such as the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), and the Income Tax Department. In certain cases, these agencies have taken \"necessary\" enforcement actions.\nIndia is currently in the process of developing a framework to regulate and monitor cryptocurrencies, but until that framework is implemented, cryptocurrency is not considered illegal in the country.\nSince 2022, earnings from cryptocurrency transactions in India have been taxed at a fixed rate of 30%.\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also expressed concerns about the use of private cryptocurrencies, viewing them as a significant threat to the country’s macroeconomic and financial stability.\nThe trends analysis revealed that virtual digital assets (VDAs), or cryptocurrencies, were linked to activities such as Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), terrorist financing, narcotics trafficking, and illegal betting and gambling. It also found that mule accounts at Indian crypto exchanges, using VPNs (virtual private networks), were receiving large volumes of deposits from unhosted and offshore exchanges, along with the laundering of funds from cybercrimes.\nThe federal agency also highlighted in its trends report concerns regarding \"high-volume\" cryptocurrency transactions, hawala activities, and online gaming transactions by individuals from \"sensitive\" regions, allegedly linked to terrorist and secessionist activities. It also pointed to money laundering through cryptocurrency by individuals from \"sensitive\" foreign countries, as well as the presence of \"illegal\" and \"unregistered\" online Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers (VASP) or crypto exchanges.\nAdditionally, the report flagged the existence of 'pump and dump' schemes involving fake coins and crypto tokens, a large volume of crypto transactions connected to operating \"illegal\" forex applications, and efforts to involve individuals suspected of participating in unlawful activities in \"sensitive regions.\"\nThe report concluded that, based on these trends and patterns, virtual digital assets (VDAs) such as Bitcoin, Tron, and Stablecoins (USDT/TRC-20) are widely used by \"illicit actors\" due to their broad acceptability and stable value.\nThe analysis found that, in most cases, offshore VDA service providers and un-hosted or unidentified wallets were being used to launder criminal proceeds.\n\"It is reiterated that the trends based on operational analysis carried out are based only on suspicion. The credible intelligence was shared with law enforcement agencies and necessary enforcement action has been taken by law enforcement agencies in some cases,\" it said.\nThe report underlined that the cryptocurrency landscape in India has been \"rapidly\" evolving and gaining \"popularity\" among investors and traders.\nThe VDAs have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to transform the financial sector and provide new opportunities for wealth creation, it stated.\nKeeping in view the challenges and risks posed by cryptocurrencies particularly with respect to money laundering and terrorist financing, India, in March 2023, brought out a regime where all crypto exchanges were required to register as reporting entities with the FIU and share suspicious transaction reports with the agency under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\nDuring the same time, all other reporting entities like private and public sector banks, capital market intermediaries, non-banking financial companies, insurance entities and credit card operators among others were asked to \"monitor\" and share reports of all crypto transactions and customers in their respective channels with the FIU.\nThe Central Economic Intelligence Bureau (CEIB), another agency under the Union finance ministry like the FIU, has also submitted a report on VDAs to the government in 2023 recommending a regulator for the crypto sector in the country.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

His wife worked as a maid to help him,” said a local police officer, requesting anonymity.\n“Local residents said that several men used to visit their house frequently to recover the loans. However, no suicide note was found near the bodies,” the officer added.\nThey are survived by four daughters. The eldest one is married while the younger ones are school students.\nThe incident happened days after a 40-year-old auto-rickshaw driver, his wife, and their 30-month-old ailing son were found dead at their home in Kolkata’s Kasba area on March 4, where police discovered that the man had taken loans for his son’s treatment.\nA suicide note, blaming two relatives and three other people, was written on a wall of the room where the bodies were found.\n“The man’s maternal uncle and his wife were arrested immediately as the deceased had blamed them for not letting him sell an ancestral property to clear the debts.

All three were rushed to hospital.\nPranay Dey told the police that all six members of the family had made a suicide pact. He said they first consumed dessert laced with sedatives, but the attempt failed.\nPrasun Dey was arrested after his discharge from hospital. He refused to have a lawyer and confessed to the crime in court.\nIn May 2023, the Patna high court said banks and finance companies cannot use recovery agents to forcefully seize vehicles of customers who defaulted on car loans. The judgment was passed by justice Rajeev Ranjan Prasad after hearings on multiple petitions.\nIn June 2023, a Madras high court division bench of chief justice S V Gangapurwala and justice P D Audikesavalu passed a similar order after hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) alleging that coercive methods were being used against farmers by banks and financial institutions.\n“No muscle power can be exercised by the agents.

The\nNifty 50 broke a three-week losing streak, closing nearly 2% higher despite global uncertainties, including the looming threat of trade wars. The rebound was fuelled by positive macroeconomic indicators, a drop in the dollar index, and liquidity support from the\nReserve Bank of India (RBI).\nAs investors prepare for a shortened trading week due to the Holi festival holiday, several key factors could influence whether the Nifty 50 can break through the crucial 23,000 mark. With global market dynamics in playâfrom foreign institutional investor activity to crude oil prices and bond yieldsânext week could be pivotal for the index.\nSectors such as metals, capital goods, and energy outperformed, supported by optimism around China's stimulus measures and lower crude oil prices. The fall in the dollar index also provided a boost to investor sentiment towards emerging markets, while US equity markets have been facing declines due to uncertainty surrounding Trumpâs economic policies, according to Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.\nThis week is likely to be a truncated one as markets will remain closed on Friday for the Holi festival holiday. The shorter week could lead to increased volatility as traders adjust their positions ahead of the break, as per ET report. Investors will be keeping an eye on several key factors that may influence the direction of the market:\nFII activityForeign investors have sold equities worth nearly Rs 25,000 crore so far in March, taking the total equity selling in 2025 to Rs 137,354 crore. There's also significant buying in Chinese stocks, driven by attractive valuations and expectations from recent positive government initiatives in China. The rally in Chinese stocks has propelled the Hang Seng Index to a YTD return of 23.48%, compared to the Niftyâs -5% return. However, experts, including VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, believe this is likely a short-term cyclical trade as Chinese corporate earnings have been disappointing for years.\nIf foreign investors increase selling pressure, it could weigh on sentiment, but any inflows could continue the positive momentum seen last week.\nDollar indexThe recent decline in the dollar index to 104 is viewed as a positive sign for emerging markets like India. A weaker dollar typically supports risk assets and boosts foreign inflows into equities, making it an important factor for the Indian market in the coming week.\nBond yieldsUS 10-year Treasury yields have dropped to 4.2%, providing relief to global equities. Lower bond yields reduce the appeal of fixed-income assets compared to stocks, which could encourage more risk-taking in equity markets.\nCrude oil pricesBrent crude oil prices hit a six-month low following OPEC+'s decision to increase production and persistent concerns about growth in the US. A decline in crude oil prices is beneficial for India, a major oil importer, as it helps curb inflation and improve corporate profit margins, especially for energy-intensive industries. Brent crude oil prices were down by 3.8% last week, marking their biggest weekly decline since November.\nMacro data and tariff concernsInvestors will be closely watching both domestic and global macroeconomic data. In India, the release of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will provide insights into economic momentum. Moreover, developments related to US inflation, non-farm payroll data, and potential tariff changes could significantly influence global market sentiment.\nTechnical indicatorsTechnical analysts suggest that Nifty 50 could continue its pullback rally in the coming sessions. \"The zone of 22,670-22,700 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index, as it coincides with the 20-day EMA and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level from the recent downward move (23,807-21,965). If the index manages to stay above the 22,700 level, we may see the rally extend towards the 23,000 and 23,300 levels in the short term,\" said experts from SBI Securities. On the downside, the 22,300-22,250 range is expected to provide support in case of any decline.\nDisclaimer: The opinions, analyses and recommendations expressed herein are those of brokerage and do not reflect the views of The Times of India.

During this time, paper money was first issued in British India\nThe Tamil Nadu government led by MK Stalin has replaced the official India Rupee symbol with the Tamil letter ‘ரூ’ as the logo for its state budget, adding fuel to the language controversy in the country.\nThis came ahead of the unveiling of the state budget by CM Stalin and when the use of regional languages in official communication has created acrimony between the state and the Centre.\nRecommended Stories\nStalin, who will be presenting the state budget for FY26 on March 14, posted a video on his X, which showed the logo of the document that read “Tamil Nadu Budget 2025-26. Everything for everyone.\" This also had the letter ரூ (read as ‘Ru’) instead of the standard rupee symbol, contrary to the state’s 2024 logo.\nAlthough India has 22 official languages and Tamil is one of them, but as a standard practice, the INR currency has only one symbol, which is inspired from the Devanagari letter र (read as Ra) and Roman letter ‘R’.\nLet us find out the evolution of the Indian Rupee symbol and who designed the rupee logo.\nIndian Currency Reforms\nThe origin of the word “Rupee\" is from Sanskrit word ‘Rupya’ which means shaped, stamped, impressed or coin and also from the Sanskrit word “raupya\" which means silver.\nSince the Republic of India was born, paper currency had been periodically transformed to reflect the needs of the time.\nPaper currency in India came into existence with the entry of European entrepreneurs and particularly with the establishment of financial institutions like the General Bank of Bengal and Bihar, the Bank of Hindoostan and the Bank of Bengal. Before paper currency, coinage was the normal form of currency and their nature differed from region to region within India.\nHistorians in fact use currency as an important source for the understanding of historical processes.\nAncient India\nThe earliest issuers of coins in the world are the Ancient Indians along with Chinese and Lydians from the Middle East. The first Indian coins were minted in the 6th Century BC by the Mahajanpadas (the Republic Kingdoms of ancient India) known as Puranas, Karshapanas or Panas.\nThese coins had irregular shapes, standard weight and are made up of silver with different markings like Saurashtra had a humped bull, Dakshin Panchala had a Swastika and Magadha had several symbols.\nThen Mauryas introduced the Punch Marked Coins minting of silver, gold, copper or lead and Indo-Greek Kushan kings brought in the Greek custom of engraving portraits on the coins.\nThe Turkish Sultans of Delhi had replaced the royal designs of Indian kings with Islamic calligraphy by the 12th Century AD. The currency was made up of gold, silver and copper known as Tanka and lower valued coin known as Jittals.\nThe Mughal Empire from 1526 AD consolidated the monetary system for the entire empire. Evolution of rupee occurred when Sher Shah Suri defeated Humayun and issued a silver coin of 178 gms known as rupiya and was divided into 40 copper pieces or paisa and during the whole Mughal period silver coin remained in use.\nBefore Independence: British India\nDuring the British East India Company, that is, 1600, the Mughal currency remained popular but in 1717 AD, Farrukh Siyar, the Mughal Emperor, gave permission to the Britishers or the English to coin Mughal money at the Bombay mint. Then British gold coins were termed as Carolina, the silver coins as Angelina, the copper coins as Cupperoon and the tin coins as Tinny.\nIn the 18th Century, the Bank of Hindostan, General Bank of Bengal and Bihar and the Bengal Bank became the first banks in India to issue paper currency i.e. during this time paper money was first issued in British India.\nIn 19th century the Britishers introduced paper money into the subcontinent. The Paper Currency Act of 1861 gave the government the monopoly of note issued throughout the vast expanse of British India.\nWhen in 1858 the Mughal reign ended and the British Crown gained control over 100 princely states, the images on the coins were replaced by portraits of the Monarch of Great Britain.\nThe first set of notes issued by the British government were the Victoria portrait series of denominations 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1000.\nThe exigencies of the First World War made it necessary to issue new notes of smaller denominations. Therefore, these notes were further replaced in 1923 with new notes carrying the portrait of King George V. The King’s portrait continued to be used on all currency bills issued by the British government in India till Independence.\nFinally, the Reserve Bank of India was set up in 1935 and empowered to issue the Government of India notes. It had also printed 10,000 rupee notes and was later demonetised after Independence. And the first paper currency issued by RBI was a Rs 5 note bearing King George VI’s portrait, in January 1938.\nRepublic Of India\nWhen India became a Republic in 1950, the portrait of King George V was removed from the currency notes and symbols of Independent India were printed. The Rupee 1 note was issued which carried the emblem of the Lion Capital in Sarnath.\nNew notes were introduced in the country in 1953 which carried texts in Hindi and had images of iconic architectural marvels like the Tanjore temple and the Gateway of India.\nDue to economic constraints of the 1960s, smaller notes were issued. In 1969, the Reserve Bank of India issued the Mahatma Gandhi Birth Centenary Commemorative design series on Rs 5 and Rs 10 notes.\nIn 1983-84, Rs 20 banknotes were issued in which at reverse of it consists of the Buddhist wheel.\nIn June 1996, Rs 10 notes were issued with front image of Gandhi and represented the fauna of India, symbolizing the biodiversity, at the back. Earlier in 1981, Rs 10 notes consisted of the lion emblem at front and back.\nIn March 1997, Rs 50 notes were issued consisting of Gandhi image at front of it and at reverse Indian Parliament.\nIn November 2000, Rs 1,000 notes were issued with the front image of Gandhi and at reverse of it represented the Indian economy, which had Grain Harvesting i.e. agricultural sector, oil rig; manufacturing sector, Space Satellite dish; Science & research, Metallurgy; Mines & Minerals and a Girl working on a computer; Inclusive Technology.\nIn November 2001, Rs 5 denomination was issued with Mahatma Gandhi’s image in front and back of the note, showing farm mechanization process i.e. the progress through agriculture.\nWho Designed The New Indian Rupee Logo?\nIn the Tamil language, the currency is called as Ruupaai. Not only in India, the same word is used Sri Lanka by Tamils for their currency.\nD. Udaya Kumar, the son of former DMK MLA N Dharmalingam, who worked in the Department of Design at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Guwahati, in 2010 won a national contest to design a symbol for the Indian rupee.\nHis design, which incorporated elements of the Devanagari and Roman scripts, was selected from among hundreds of entries to represent the Indian currency.\nThe design is based on the Devanagari letter ‘र’ and has a double horizontal line at the top half.\nAmidst the rupee symbol row, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya said on X, “Udaya Kumar Dharmalingam is an Indian academic and designer, son of a former DMK MLA, who designed the Indian rupee (₹) sign, which was accepted by Bharat. Chief Minister MK Stalin is insulting Tamilians by dropping the ₹ sign from the Tamil Nadu Budget 2025-26 document. Just how ridiculous can one get?\"", "text_len": 7709}

But we face geo-economic uncertainty. What is going to be the game plan? How are we going to negotiate with the US?\nIn all fairness, I think I would leave it for (Commerce Minister) Piyush Goyal to determine how he is going to take forward the whole negotiations. He and his team are at it even as we speak. I think both sides (India and the US) should have ambition for a good treaty. And nobody can fault that, particularly for India. We still need to do a lot more to strengthen our exports. I am sure the commerce minister is quite seized of this. And he would take this (India-US) agreement to meet the ambitions that we have in terms of growth. That would guide his negotiations.\nGeo-economic fragmentation is now a reality. In some ways, it's a reversal of the forces of globalisation that have created a lot of prosperity. Do you think this will impede India’s growth momentum?\nI see an opportunity in each of the challenges that exist—be it the geo-economic fragmentation or tariff war or some economies reaching a deflationary level or the lack of demand overseas. As our Prime Minister says, “Where there is a challenge, there could be an opportunity” and this tendency is being built into all of us in the Cabinet. And it is for us to very smartly move to make sure that this is the opportunity that India was waiting for. After all, it is another 22 years before we should reach the goal of a Viksit Bharat.\nWhile other countries also face offensive tariff action, there is a real chance that some of them could dump their goods in India. Are we guarding against it?\nThere are small and medium Indian manufacturers who prefer cheaper inputs. But even then, the larger consideration should be to allow them access to cheaper inputs without letting them become a victim of dumping. And among the stakeholders, there are sections which prefer complete stoppage of dumped goods and some others who prefer a calibrated approach to it. The government’s task is to make sure that we plan for it and balance everybody's interests.\nIs it time to look at a more comprehensive rationalisation of GST slabs?\nIt was late 2022 when we started this exercise of rationalising the Goods and Services Tax (GST)—both rationalisation of the rates as well as the number of slabs, and review of compliances and the process itself. In early 2023, some people were saying, “You are not even allowing the GST to settle; after all, it was launched in 2017 and you're already starting to revamp it.” So, there was an element of discouragement. But we didn't stop it.\nDifferent groups of ministers were looking at it. And every time there is a state government election and there's a change of ministers, we revamped the committees. But that work has almost reached a finale. The groups have done excellent work, but I still have taken it upon myself to, once more, completely review each of the group’s works, and then take it to the GST Council to see if we can come to a final agreement on these. So, we are very close to coming to a final call on some of the very critical issues—reduction and rationalisation of rates, looking at the number of slabs, and so on.\nIs there any possibility you can give us a glimpse into what is in store any more than what you have said?\nI think I was very clear about the reduction in rates. And that is not as though we are now exploitatively high in rates now. At the time when the GST was launched (in July 2017), the revenue neutral rate was somewhere around 15.8% and by 2023, we had already brought that to 11.4%. And when it was launched, the average tax was itself lower than what existed before the GST rollout. So, let me dispel any (notion) here that the GST has made life costlier. Item by item, I would challenge anyone to tell me if there is any one item for which the tax has gone up after the GST introduction. So the clue that you want is, it will come down even further.\nPrivate investment is somewhat narrowly focused on a few sectors. What would be your expectation for a more broad-based resurgence in private investment?\nIf industry is investing only in some sectors and not in others—these are commercial decisions. I am not asking them to say why they are or why they are not (investing), but I would like them to talk. If they don’t speak out, how will the government have any clue on how things are moving?\nThe PM spoke about a deregulation commission. You’ve also spoken about it in the budget. What kind of a body would it be? Is it going to be a permanent body?\nI have not thought about it being a permanent body. For the financial sector, you have the Financial Stability Development Council. But for the non-financial regulators, and there are several of them… (there is no such forum). And between the regulators, the entities that are being regulated do have a difficulty as to who they should approach for various things. And this is one of the issues on which the coordination of inter-regulatory bodies is necessary.\nThe stock markets are seeing dizzying volatility. Do you see a path toward calmer markets?\nIt’s like asking, will the world be calm? Will wars come to an end? Will the Red Sea be safer? Will there be no sea pirates? Can I comment on it or would anyone like to comment?\nFPI sell-off has led to a clamour for a reduction in the capital gains tax on them. Do you see any merit in this argument?\nThese are taxation matters. The budget session is resuming on Monday. So, this is the most inappropriate time for a finance minister to talk on tax.\nPublic sector banks need capital support. Will the government cut its stake below 51%?\nNot specific to today’s context, but that (stake) we have to reduce. We want to have more and more retail investors to be actively buying and selling shares (of state-run banks).\nThere have been some concerns over NBFC funding to micro-credit institutions…\nThere were some concerns at least a year ago. But I think the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) came in time and gave good guidance (to these entities). Sometimes people thought that (the step by the RBI) was very tight. I think now again RBI has given some relaxation. But it’s not every NBFC (that had risky exposure) but some which are small and very adventurous. So, I am sure it will settle down.\nIndia is negotiating free trade agreements with a number of economies. What should be our guiding principles?\nThe first principle is putting India’s interest first. In some of the agreements done earlier, the negotiations were very speedily handled—I don’t want to attribute any intentional malice or anything—or the language was very loose or there were hasty understandings of the collateral (damage). So, today the commerce ministry is engaged in the review of many of these FTAs that were signed. Today ensuring India’s interest in FTA negotiations is absolutely our top priority.\nIndia is projected to grow between 6.3% and 6.8% next year. What would you say are the two or three things that need to fall into place for us to achieve one or two percentage points more in growth rate?\nThis is an audience which knows about the things that are going to contribute to higher growth. So, there’s no point in me getting into those details. But there is one thing that I definitely would like to tell the media and make all of us think about. Like the markets, there is a sentiment which prevails in a country to grow. You need to have positivity, you need to have self-belief. And you need to be the last person to run down your own country. You need to believe in India’s capacity; if anything, it is this sentiment which is missing today.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 8103}

By comparison, the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen weakened 1.7% and 0.7%, respectively, during the period.\n“The government does not want the currency to depreciate too much,\" the official told Mint, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The official said that the government and RBI are hopeful that the rupee will eventually climb back to December levels and that India’s forex reserves are sufficient to defend it.\nAlso read | Mint Primer: Why it will be a baptism by fire for new RBI Guv\nThe rupee averaged 84.99 against the dollar in December against 86.27 in January, as per data from RBI.\nQueries emailed to RBI and the finance ministry remained unanswered.\nMalhotra was initially expected to let the currency depreciate, making it more competitive. However, Mint understands that RBI has decided to continue defending the currency and sticking to its stance of curbing unbridled volatility.\nExcessive exchange-rate stability of the past two years, however, may have come at a huge cost to the economy--as Mint reported on 16 January. During this period, the rupee was so stable that the International Monetary Fund reclassified India’s exchange-rate regime to ‘stabilised arrangement’ from ‘floating’ in December 2023.\nIndia’s forex reserves have also fallen $7.7 billion from end-March 2024 to $638.7 billion on 28 February, according to the latest RBI data. The kitty has shrunk $16.2 billion from the beginning of December.\nAlso read | RBI reduces risk weights on bank loans to NBFCs, MFIs\nWhile India’s foreign currency buffer has doubled in the past 10 years, these are volatile capital flows. As former RBI deputy governor BP Kanungo put it in a speech in 2019: “One also needs to bear in mind that India’s forex reserves are borrowed reserves and not built out of export surplus.\"\nThis year until 7 March, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have net sold Indian equities worth $15.9 billion, according to data from the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL). In 2024, FPIs were net buyers of $124 million in domestic stocks.\nWhile RBI’s efforts are aimed at curbing volatility, these are being countered by significant foreign outflows, the government official cited earlier said. As the dollar is expected to strengthen, there will be pressure on the rupee, and it will take time for the currency to reach the desired level, the official said.\nThe past week has been better, though. News agency Reuters reported on Friday that the Indian rupee posted its best weekly gain in over two years as the US dollar declined sharply against major peers, which also helped lift the local unit's regional counterparts.\nExperts, however, believe that given the external environment, the rupee will depreciate.\nAlso read | Why RBI dialled up dollar sales in the forward market last quarter\n“The only thing RBI should try and do is to smooth out the slide and volatility,\" said Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ Banking Group. “If tariffs do happen on Indian goods from April, then the rupee will have to weaken, and there is no way around it.\"\nUS President Donald Trump recently announced plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on certain trading nations starting April, levying the same rates as they charge on American products.\nAccording to Nim, any aggressive defence of the rupee in the current scenario is unlikely to be fruitful and is not advisable. “That's because the spot reserves are lower than what we have had in the past, but the forward book RBI has been using to defend the currency has also slipped into a sharply negative short position. If the global environment warrants and the tariffs materialise, then RBI should let the rupee weaken.\"\nOthers said with more than two years of stability like a peg currency, the rupee started weakening against the dollar in the last few months, implying that the central bank let it weaken. “The forex reserve level also suggests that RBI has adopted an approach of leaving currencies largely to market forces,\" said Gopal Tripathi, head of treasury and capital markets at Jana Small Finance Bank.

The Nifty Midcap 100 and Nifty Smallcap 100 indices shed 1.6% and 2.1%, respectively.\nMid-cap and small-cap stocks are now trading roughly 20.5% and 23% below their record highs, while the benchmark Nifty remains 14.5% off its all-time peak.\nDespite last week’s nearly 2% rally—driven by bargain hunting after a $1 trillion market wipeout—investors continue to weigh valuations, particularly in large-cap stocks, amid ongoing volatility.\nExpert View\nGlobal headwinds continue to drag the market sentiment, with the rise in U.S. unemployment rates and tariffs leading to uncertainty, indicating that volatility is here to stay for the near term, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.“The domestic macros are favouring investors to start accumulating the beaten-down stocks with caution in the short term, while the long term appears attractive. A slew of economic indicators this week, U.S. and India CPI data, will be keenly watched by investors for any ease in the current volatility,\" said Nair.\nGlobal Markets\nEuropean stocks declined on Monday following a mixed trading session in Asia, as uncertainty lingered over President Donald Trump’s next move on tariffs.\nChina led the losses in Asian markets, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropping 1.9% to 23,783.49, while the Shanghai Composite edged down 0.2% to 3,366.16. Adding to concerns about the world’s second-largest economy, data released on Sunday showed China’s consumer prices fell in February for the first time in 13 months, reflecting persistently weak demand and the impact of the early Lunar New Year holiday.\nIn contrast, Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.4% to close at 37,028.27. Meanwhile, Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto was in Washington for discussions aimed at preventing higher U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobile exports.\nMarket sentiment improved slightly on Friday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reassured investors that the U.S. economy remains stable. He indicated no immediate need for interest rate cuts, stating, “The economy is fine. It doesn’t need us to do anything really. We can wait, and we should wait.”\nCurrency Watch\nThe Indian rupee saw its sharpest single-day decline in two weeks on Monday, slipping 0.5% to close at 87.33 against the U.S. dollar. The drop, its steepest since February 25, was driven by increased dollar bids due to the maturity of positions in non-deliverable forwards (NDF) and weakness in the Chinese yuan.Meanwhile, the dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of six major currencies, edged down 0.15% to 103.65.\nCrude Impact\nOil prices remained steady on Monday as concerns over U.S. import tariffs' impact on global economic growth and fuel demand, along with rising output from OPEC+ producers, dampened investor appetite for riskier assets. By 08:56 GMT, Brent crude slipped 11 cents to $70.25 per barrel.\nFII/DII Tracker\nForeign Institutional Investors (FIIs) continued their selling spree on March 7, offloading equities worth Rs 2,035.10 crore.

India toh angrezi naam hai,\" he said.\nThe India vs Bharat row began after the opposition parties, which formed the INDIA bloc against the BJP for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had then questioned the choice of name. He cited examples of organisations like Popular Front of India and said they also use India in their names.\nAccording to Hosabale, the British regime left a deep imprint that continues to shape Indian consciousness. He cited historical instances of cultural erasure, from the destruction of temples and gurukuls during the invasion by the Mughals to the imposition of English as a dominant language.\n“Mughals invaded Bharat, destroyed our temples, gurukuls, ancient culture, dominated us, but it did not make us feel inferior to the extent the British did. British rule made us feel that they were better than us. The idea of ‘Engraziyat’ still persists. That is why the business of English medium schools flourishes here,\" he said.\nHe also accused Left-liberal historical narratives of portraying Bharat’s past rulers as oppressors. “They want us to believe that all our kings were oppressors. They made that narrative, which was misleading,” said the RSS general secretary.\nHosabale also invoked VS Naipaul’s critiques of post-colonial societies. “A new wave must sweep across the nation, one that does not diminish others or demean other nations but reclaims our own identity,\" he said. “Bharat will never stand for Dadagiri (one up-manship), or to destroy other countries. Bharat will always stand for global good. But, before that, we have to stay united and lead by example,\" he told the gathering.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Digital payments have become the preferred mode of payment for many of us.”However, surveys have shown that nearly 40 per cent of our adult population still do not use digital payments. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of awareness or familiarity with using digital payments,” he said.\nThe 5th Digital Payments Awareness Week (DPAW) is being observed from March 10 to 16.DPAW is an initiative to highlight the impact and importance of digital payments and to create awareness about the safe usage of digital payment products.Under the mission ’Har Payment Digital’, the theme for the current year is ’India Pays Digitally’.This theme reflects India’s transformative journey toward a digitally empowered citizenry, with the ubiquity and convenience of digital payments, the RBI said.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

With its net worth at Rs 65,102 crore as of December 31, the impact is likely to be around Rs 1,530 crore – more than Rs 1,401.3-crore net profit in the third quarter of the current financial year.\nThe bank informed the exchanges that it has appointed an external agency to independently review its internal findings and is now awaiting the final report, which will determine the accounting treatment of any resulting impact on its financial statements.\n“During internal review of processes relating to other asset and other liability accounts of the derivative portfolio, post implementation of RBI Master Direction – Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks (Directions), 2023, issued in September 2023, including accounting of derivatives, applicable from April 1, 2024, the bank noted some discrepancies in these account balances,” said the exchange notification.\nThe lender also added that its profitability and capital adequacy remained healthy to absorb this one-time impact.\nEarlier in the day, shares of IndusInd Bank plunged nearly 6% intraday to their lowest level since July 2022 after the RBI granted MD & CEO Sumant Kathpalia only a one-year extension, against the board application for three years. Investors were jittery about the bank’s near-term earnings outlook. The stock closed at Rs 900 apiece, down about 4% on the BSE on Monday.\nSpeaking to an analyst on Monday evening, Kathpalia said the RBI was aware of this issue, which may have influenced its decision to grant an extension for only one year. “I don’t know what is the rationale for them to give me one-year (extension). But I think they are uncomfortable with my leadership skills and we have to respect that,” said Kathpalia. The board will evaluate both external and internal candidates for the CEO position, he added.\nReacting to the RBI’s decision, multiple analysts downgraded the stock and cut its price targets. UBS downgraded the stock to ‘sell’ from its earlier rating of ‘neutral’ and also cut its price target to Rs 850 from Rs 1,070 earlier. The one-year tenure is negative for the bank’s near-term earnings outlook as the focus will shift back to regulatory prescriptions, said the brokerage.\nOf the 51 analysts covering IndusInd Bank, 30 maintain ‘buy’ rating, 15 have ‘hold’ and six have ‘sell’ rating.\nBofA Securities downgraded the stock to an ‘underperform’ from its earlier rating of ‘buy’ and cut its price target to Rs 850 from Rs 1,250 earlier. The brokerage expressed concerns that it might take 12-18 months to gain clarity on the bank’s management and future strategic decisions, noting that a re-rating for IndusInd Bank is unlikely until further clarity emerges.\nJefferies cut its price target on IndusInd Bank to Rs 1,080 from Rs 1,200 earlier but maintained ‘buy’ on the stock. The brokerage said the RBI’s decision may prompt the bank to begin the succession process and expects the stock to remain rangebound until succession clarity emerges, and stability is seen in the microfinance and auto loan segments.", "text_len": 3363}

But the pre-Holi gains are likely to be short-lived with heatwaves predicted in the country as early as March. Vegetables have been the main driver of inflation in the last 12 months, and the correction is set to reverse when winter stocks run down. Inflation is officially projected to average 20% higher than the target in the current financial year. But it could undershoot in the January-March quarter. Moderation expected beyond March is predicated on a normal monsoon, and retail inflation should arrive at its target without any serious rainfall deficiency. This opens a window for RBI to push ahead with interest rate cuts. However, it can't look through spikes in food inflation.\nRBI could, over the course of summer, reverse a third of the cumulative 2.5-percentage-point rate hikes it undertook during monetary tightening. It will also be working in tandem to ease systemic liquidity during and after the year-end hump.

But it will have a clearer picture in June. However, heat-related data is available in real time and is a leading indicator for food inflation.

Drawing parallels to past events at RBL Bank and Yes Bank, CLSA noted that while market sentiment heavily influences short-term movements, stock prices eventually realign with fundamentals.\n\"When the RBI granted a one-year extension to RBL Bank’s MD and later appointed a PSU banker, the stock plunged nearly 60% as the market feared hidden risks. However, over the following quarters, no major issues surfaced, and the stock eventually recovered its losses,\" said CLSA analyst Piran Engineer.\nA similar situation occurred with Yes Bank when the RBI abruptly terminated its MD’s tenure in September 2018, instructing him to step down by January 2019. The stock plunged more than 50% during this period. However, in February 2019, the bank disclosed a ‘nil NPL divergence’ report, reassuring investors that its gross non-performing loans (GNPLs) matched the RBI’s assessment.\n\"The market was relieved that the loan book had no hidden risks, and the stock surged 30% in a single day. It further rallied 20-30% over the following month. However, the gains were short-lived as the new MD later revealed a significant proportion of bad assets,\" explained CLSA analyst Piran Engineer.\nCLSA emphasized that sentiment will drive short-term stock movements, stating, \"No fundamental argument is stronger than the narrative that exists at that point in time. However, over the medium term, the market is flexible—as data points to the contrary emerge, stock prices tend to align with fundamentals.\"\nWhat Could Drive IndusInd Bank Shares Higher?\nDespite prevailing negativity, CLSA identified key factors that could support a rebound in IndusInd Bank’s stock. A recovery in the microfinance sector and improved banking system liquidity, potentially aided by rate cuts, could serve as near-term fundamental positives.\nAdditionally, a non-fundamental catalyst could be the bank’s promoters securing RBI approval to increase their stake, particularly after completing their acquisition of Reliance Capital. Any promoter stake purchase could restore investor confidence and push the stock higher.\nFor now, sentiment remains the dominant force, but if history is any indication, fundamentals may take over in the medium term.\nAlso read | IndusInd's top two executives sold Rs 157 crore of shares in 2023, 2024\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

The company is opening new branches in Odisha and Maharashtra, adjacent to its strongholds of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. “We continue to expand within existing states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, where we maintain a branch every 50-60 km,” he added.\nAs of December 2024, the company had 298 branches across six states. “Our average ticket size per loan is `8.5 lakh, and we are increasing it to `10 lakh. This `1.5 lakh increase per loan will contribute to AUM growth,” Balaji said. The company also aims to raise the number of files logged per salesperson per month from three to four, driving 25% additional growth. As of December 2024, the company’s AUM stood at `10,226 crore, registering 27% year-on-year growth.\nBalaji said the Reserve Bank of India’s recent 0.25% repo rate cut would further boost affordable housing demand. “The housing shortage is particularly acute in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, where we operate, and demand in this segment remains strong,” he said, adding that the company is confident of achieving 30% annual growth over the next three to four years.\nFurther, he said the rate cut would support net interest margin (NIM) expansion.\nThe company’s outstanding borrowings stood at `6,455 crore as of Q3FY25, with 47% linked to fixed rates and 53% to variable rates. “Within the variable portion, 30% is linked to MCLR, while 23% is tied to market-related rates. Since the repo rate was cut by 0.25%, we expect to see some benefit in the coming months, depending on the rate reset cycle agreed upon with our lenders,” he said.\nFor the 30% linked to MCLR, Aptus expects the impact will take longer, as banks need to recalibrate their deposit rates first. “We anticipate seeing the initial impact in the next quarter, with full repricing benefits materialising by the first quarter of the next fiscal,” he added.\nThe company’s gross non-performing assets (GNPA) stood at 1.28% in the latest quarter. Balaji said Aptus handles all operations in-house—sourcing, credit underwriting, legal, technical, and collections—ensuring better control over loan quality.\nAptus primarily lends to self-employed individuals owning around 1,000 sq. ft. of land in Tier 3 and Tier 4 locations for constructing houses for self-use. “The plot itself acts as security, and we fund only the construction cost. As a result, our loan-to-value (LTV) ratio remains between 35-40%, meaning the customer’s equity in the property is much higher than the loan amount,” he noted.", "text_len": 3113}

The Bank’s share price too crashed 27 per cent on March 11, hitting the new 52-week low mark.\nGiven the impact assessment, this leads to uncertainty in context of lower-than-expected tenure extension of MD & CEO Sumant Kathpalia and the exit of CFO Gobind Jain earlier.\nWhile the timing of this event is strange, coming on the heels of the lower tenure extension, there is a lot left unanswered: 1) Why was this not highlighted earlier, 2) How is such a lapse possible despite concurrent audits, 3) Why did the auditors not share any qualifications, 4) Are there any additional challenges, and 5) How did this issue go undetected for more than five years?\nElara Capital said, “This poses a series of questions on lapses in terms of processes and sanctity of book value. Beside the one-year extension of MD & CEO and key management positions, there are likely to be key transitions in the next couple of years, adding to more uncertainty. We expect further stock correction, but the question remains what comes next?”\nTo put things in context…\nThis came just days after the Bank had informed that the RBI granted its approval for re-appointment of Sumant Kathpalia as MD & CEO of IndusInd Bank for a further period of one year with effect from March 24, 2025. This was despite the Bank’s board requesting a three-year reappointment.\nBarely three days after its CEO got a shorter extension from the RBI, IndusInd Bank, on Monday, said that an internal review of its derivative portfolio revealed discrepancies, which could hit its net worth by approximately 2.35 per cent as of December 2024. The private sector lender’s net worth as of December 31 stood at Rs 65,102 crore and the impact is likely to be around Rs 1,530 crore which is more than Rs 1,401.3 crore net profit record in the third quarter of FY25.\nThe Bank has, in parallel, appointed a reputed external agency to independently review and validate the internal findings. In the exchange filing, it said, “A final report of the external agency is awaited and basis which the Bank will appropriately consider any resultant impact in its financial statements.” IndusInd Bank further maintained that its profitability and capital adequacy remain healthy enough to absorb this one-time impact.\nBefore the letter exposing discrepancies was released on the exchanges, CEO Sumant Kathpalia had acknowledged that the RBI was aware of the derivatives issue before granting him a shorter-than-expected one-year tenure extension. In an investor call, he said, “I think the RBI is uncomfortable with my leadership skills in running the bank, and we have to respect that.” Now, the board has been tasked with evaluating both internal and external candidates for the CEO position.\nWhat really happened?\nIndusInd Bank internally hedged forex borrowers by entering internal derivative contracts with its trading desk. Elara Capital summarised, “The trading desk then hedged this exposure externally in the market. External trade was marked to the market, meaning its value fluctuated with market rates, negatively affecting P&L. The internal trade was accounted for using swap cost accounting or swap valuation, affecting asset book instead of P&L. External trades moved with the market, but internal ones followed swap valuation, which might not reflect market movements. This mismatch could temporarily bolster reported NII while suppressing actual trading losses. But the external hedge was MTM, and this created a mismatch in income recognition. Over time, if internal trade diverged significantly from external market movements, the real impact surfaced when the trade was unwound or matured.”\nLet’s take a look at timeline of events…\nThe past few years have been challenging for IndusInd Bank. In May 2021, a technical glitch at its microfinance subsidiary, BFIL, led to 84,000 loans being disbursed without recorded customer consent.\nMore recently, in January 2025, CFO Gobind Jain resigned, just before Q3 earnings, while on March 7, RBI approved CEO Sumant Kathpalia’s tenure for only one year instead of three. And the latest discrepancy revelation has only added to governance concerns, raising questions about compliance.\nPromoter support intact\nMeanwhile, Ashok Hinduja, Chairman of IndusInd International Holdings, played down the derivative discrepancies issues and called it “normal” and “routine”. He went on to add that he expects the problem to be resolved and reiterated full promoter support to the Bank management and the board. He even assured that the bank remains financially strong with an operating profit of Rs 11,000 crore in nine months.\nSnapshot of Q3 performance\nIndusInd Bank had, in January, released its fiscal third quarter earnings report with profit at Rs 1,402.3 crore, down 39 per cent YoY from Rs 2,301 crore in the same quarter last year. Net interest income (NII), meanwhile, fell 1.3 per cent to Rs 5,228.1 crore from Rs 5,295.6 crore a year ago.", "text_len": 5130}

Food inflation has been a continuous challenge for policymakers aiming to keep retail inflation sustainably close to 4 per cent.\nDespite global inflation concerns, India has largely managed to maintain control over its price levels.\nThe RBI has kept the repo rate and its key lending rate at elevated levels to ensure inflation remains in check.

US corporate earnings remain healthy,\" he reasoned.\nThe Chief Middle East and APAC Investment Strategist at BlackRock Investment Institute believes India stands out as one of the fastest-growing major economies globally.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 6.5 percent GDP (gross domestic product) growth for India in 2025 — well above the global and emerging market averages. Powell expects this economic outperformance to continue, driven by structural strengths, such as favourable demographics and rising productivity.\nHe is of the view that this broader structural story presents opportunities.\nAre you concerned about global growth due to the trade war?\nOur scenarios framework – mapping potential outcomes for different mixes of growth, inflation and policy responses – helps us navigate this evolving market and economic landscape. In the past few weeks, the markets have been increasingly pricing in a potential US recession. We disagree. Why? Current US economic fundamentals do not point to a recession. Job creation has slowed slightly but the labour market remains strong in contrast to soft survey data showing declining consumer confidence.\nUS corporate earnings remain healthy with consensus eyeing about 12% growth for S&P 500 earnings this year versus 14% last September. Tech earnings expectations have adjusted lower, but the sector still has the fastest expected growth this year and underlying fundamentals remain healthy — free cash flow is now at 30% of total sales, the highest share since 1990. On a six- to 12-month horizon, we remain overweight US equities. But uncertainty over US macro and foreign policy is unusually high. If that persists, it could drag on growth. The next few weeks will be key to see if uncertainty subsides. The White House’s full tariff plan is due in April, for example.\nDo you expect India to sustain more than 6 percent growth in the coming years?\nIndia stands out as one of the fastest-growing major economies, globally. The IMF projects a GDP growth of 6.5 percent in 2025 — well above global and emerging market averages. We expect this economic outperformance to persist, driven by structural strengths such as favourable demographics and rising productivity. This broader structural story presents opportunities, in our view.\nIndia’s demographic edge is a cornerstone of our upbeat long-term outlook. A young and expanding workforce is set to sustain consumption growth and drive productivity gains over the coming decades. This demographic dividend, combined with the possibility of AI-driven productivity gains, could amplify India’s economic potential, in our view.\nIndia’s structural strengths outweigh near-term softness from weak domestic sentiments and uncertainty over US trade policy, in our view. A narrow focus on cyclical trends — such as slowing growth — risks missing the bigger picture and the opportunities it create.\nSigns of moderating growth and easing inflation have prompted the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to act. The central bank recently cut its key interest rate for the first time in nearly five years, lowering the repo rate from 6.5 percent to 6.25 percent to help counter slowing growth. We expect further rate cuts over the next five years.\nWhat more would you like to see from the government in terms of policies that can not only lift economic growth but also attract FDI on a large scale?\nWe see trade protectionism emerging as a key risk under the new US administration. For India, however, the impact of potential US tariffs look relatively contained — goods exports to the US make up less than 5 percent of its GDP, according to World Bank data. This suggests India is far less exposed to direct trade disruptions than economies more dependent on US demand.\nThat said, India could face disproportionate pressure due to the wide tariff gap between the two nations. India imposes higher tariffs on US imports than the US does on Indian goods. This imbalance has historically resulted in US businesses paying more in tariffs to India than vice versa, making India a potential target for policy retaliation.\nThe US and India agreed to launch bilateral trade talks for the first time. The outcome remains unclear — whether a formal treaty or a mix of tariff and regulatory agreements. Even if retaliatory tariffs were imposed, we believe the economic impact would remain limited.\nWhich sectors would you consider for long-term investment in India?\nWe advocate above-benchmark allocations to Indian equities within strategic portfolios with investment horizons of five years or more as the country’s economic transformation unfolds.\nWe believe structural shifts underway in India map neatly onto the five mega forces we see shaping the world now and in the future. These shifts include its demographic advantage, supercharged digitisation and resilience in navigating a fragmented geopolitical landscape.\nIndia’s turning investment and capex cycle, along with recovering rural consumption, underpin long-term structural positives. The capex cycle is driven by strong corporate and government balance sheets and a robust pipeline of projects in utilities, renewables, manufacturing, and real estate.\nDo you think the US equity markets are overvalued now?\nEconomies around the globe are being transformed by mega forces. These forces could continue to shift the long-term trend, making various outcomes possible. We think investors should keep the big picture in mind and can find opportunities by tapping into the waves of transformation we see ahead in the real economy. AI and the low-carbon transition require investment potentially on par with the industrial revolution.\nAs we rethink investing in our outlook, we believe that valuations are not that stretched, as we look beyond current valuations in this transformation. Valuations tend to matter more for returns over a long-term horizon than in the near term. Some US equity valuation measures – whether price-to-earnings ratios or equity risk premiums – look rich relative to history. But they may not tell the full story. The equity market’s changing sectoral composition reflects the transformation taking hold. So, comparing today's index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges.\nDo you foresee the next rate cut from the US Federal Reserve only in the second half of 2025?\nInflation cooled across developed markets in 2024, but structural forces did the hard work, rather than central bank rate hikes -- notably, the post-pandemic normalisation of the goods and labour markets, and an unexpected rise in US immigration that expanded the labour force.\nLast week’s US jobs report showed the pace of job creation has eased somewhat, but if immigration slows back towards historical levels – and we some evidence it is already slowing – job creation would need to slow quite a bit further to prevent inflation picking up. Indeed, wage pressures are still too high for inflation to settle back at the Fed’s 2 percent target.\nWe think persistent inflation pressures mean that the Fed will need to keep rates high for longer, with no more than one or two cuts this year. We see the Fed’s policy changes as a recalibration of policy back towards a neutral level, rather than a traditional ‘rate cutting cycle’ as part of a business cycle.\nDo you believe the Trump administration's tariffs risk will persist for a couple of months more before easing?\nThe US briefly rolled out the largest tariffs in nearly a century on March 4 -- 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian and Mexican imports and an extra 10 percent on China. While most North American tariffs were later put on ice for another month, we think an average effective tariff rate of about 10 percent could be the eventual landing zone – with volatility along the way.\nWhat matters more for near-term growth are pains due to elevated uncertainty, including a potential US government shutdown. The markets expect weaker US growth to push the Fed to cut policy rates, as in a typical business cycle. Yet, we see a tough trade-off between supporting growth and curbing sticky inflation, limiting how much the Fed can cut. That reinforces our expectation of policy rates above the pre-pandemic levels and higher bond yields.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Reason: the regulator’s belief that steps have already been taken and things have improved, and to avoid over-regulation, two people aware of the matter said on the condition of anonymity.\nAccording to the first person, the department of consumer affairs (DoCA), the parent organization of Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), believes that telecom regulator Trai (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) has taken corrective measures to curb unwanted calls, and the CCPA has observed a change in the behaviour of telecom service providers.\n“Telecom service providers are working closely with Trai to reduce unwanted calls by adopting measures such as colour coding to identify spam and marketing calls, along with changes in registered caller identification,\" said the second person cited above. “Given these efforts, the CCPA is considering putting on hold the issuance of separate guidelines for handling pesky calls.\"\nTo be sure, Bharti Airtel’s vice chairman and managing director Gopal Vittal said during the release of the company’s quarterly report in February that Airtel’s anti-spam tool “has brought significant relief, notifying nearly 252 million unique customers and effectively combating the SPAM menace\".\nAlso read | Mint Explainer: Trai's latest crackdown on spam calls—inside the latest measures\nVittal added that the spam tool identifies more than one million unique spammers making more than 130 million calls daily. “Additionally, our solution detects over 7 million spam SMSes daily,\" he said.\nThe CCPA’s move comes a year after a stakeholders’ meeting was held in March 2024, where punitive action was proposed against firms for violating privacy and breaching consumer rights. A committee comprising government officials from different ministries, regulators and voluntary consumer organisations was formed the same month, and three to four stakeholder meetings were conducted thereafter.\nHowever, the CCPA will continue to address complaints registered on the national consumer helpline (NCH) regarding unwanted calls under its existing norms for unethical trade practices and consumer protection, the second person said.\nQueries emailed to the consumer affairs ministry and Trai remained unanswered till press time.\nSteps taken by Trai\nAfter the consumer affairs ministry took the lead in making pesky calls a punishable offence, Trai implemented several measures to hold telecom operators accountable through punitive actions.\nThe telecom regulator introduced the 160 number series to help consumers identify telemarketing calls. It has also taken measures like blacklisting violators, disconnecting telecom resources, and requiring URL whitelisting to prevent fraud and phishing scams.\nRead this | India’s burgeoning spam calls problem, in 7 charts\nTrai also made it mandatory for telecom operators to monitor call and SMS patterns to detect spammers in real time. Under the amended Telecom Commercial Communications Customer Preference Regulations, telecom operators face fines ranging from ₹2 lakh for the first violation to ₹10 lakh for repeated offences if they misreport unsolicited commercial communications (UCC).\nIndustry feedback\nThe consumer affairs department’s move is seen as part of policy deregulation to give concerned ministries greater oversight. However, experts view it as a setback for consumers, arguing that dedicated guidelines would have helped tackle unsolicited calls from agents or representatives across various service sectors, including financial services.\n“A dedicated guideline for a specific sector ensures a more focused approach to addressing complaints about unwanted calls,\" said Ashim Sanyal, chief executive of Consumer Voice, a consumer rights advocacy organization. “It also empowers consumers by providing clear regulations tailored to a particular category.\"\nAlso read | The losing battle against phone spam\nFor perspective, the committee that was formed in March 2024 comprised officials from the department of telecommunications, the department of financial services, the ministry of housing and urban affairs, the Reserve Bank of India, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority, representatives from the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), telemarketing companies, and voluntary consumer organizations.\nAs of now, the CCPA has issued separate guidelines, including the Prevention of Misleading Advertisements in the Coaching Sector, 2024, the Prevention and Regulation of Greenwashing or Misleading Environmental Claims, 2024, and the Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023, among others.\nThe CCPA is also working on bringing separate guidelines for surrogate advertisements.

Though CLSA has cut estimates by 9-25% (for the one-off accounting hit and lower growth) and cut target price to Rs 900 per share from Rs1,300 per share, the target implies over 30% upside from current levels.\nCLSA, drawing parallels from similar events at other banks like RBL Bank and Yes Bank and highlights that “In the near-term, sentiment alone drives the stock, but in the medium-term fundamentals do. When the RBI gave a one-year extension to the MD of RBL Bank, and later appointed a PSU banker, the stock crashed 60%. The street feared there would be skeletons in the closet, however, over the ensuing quarters nothing emerged and the stock recovered its losses. A similar but temporary phenomenon happened with Yes Bank, with a forced-CEO exit followed by a nil GNPL divergence report. IIB’s stock price trajectory should be no different in our view.”\nCLSA on IndusInd Bank: What could happen now?\nThe IndusInd Bank share price continues to be under pressure but what’s going to happen next? CLSA predicts that “there will be lingering uncertainty over more skeletons in the closet and management continuity. If a PSU banker is appointed, there would be even more negative sentiment for the stock.” According to the international brokerage house, “the potential invoking of the promoter’s stock pledge by its lenders would add to the uncertainty.” But, over time, they believe “its fundamentals will take over. If IndusInd Bank delivers numbers broadly in line with expectations over the next 4-6 quarters, we believe concerns will subside.”\nCLSA on IndusInd Bank: Are there any positives?\nAccording to CLSA, there are fundamental positives in the near-term for IndusInd Bank. These are\n- ”Recovery in microfinance\n- Respite for margins from better banking system liquidity, and rate cuts.”\nThe report added that a “non-fundamental positive could be the promoter getting RBI approval to increase its stake in the bank (after its acquisition of Reliance Capital is completed).”\nCLSA on IndusInd Bank: RBI’s role\nCLSA report on IndusInd Bank states “mixed signals from the regulator:” While the one-year extension is similar to RBL, RBI has been quite active over the past two years in identifying and rectifying flaws/deficiencies in lenders. They highlighted that though “there were no red flags raised publicly. The recent accounting discrepancy was not reported by either the bank’s auditors or the RBI over the past 5-7 years.” However, CLSA believes that the RBI cutting the MD’s tenure to one year may not necessarily be due to asset quality issues. “There could be other factors. The RBI’s one-year extension to IndusInd Bank’s MD is similar to what it did for RBL Bank in 2021. However, in Yes Bank’s case, the RBI abruptly terminated the MD’s tenure within 3-4 months of its announcement. In both cases, the stocks recovered after some time (in Yes’ case, it was a temporary recovery),” CLSA added.", "text_len": 3075}

Growing Concerns Amid IndusInd Bank Controversy\nFollowing the news of financial irregularities at IndusInd Bank depositors are now facing growing concerns; Here's what you should know\nIndusInd Bank Customer Deposits Safe? Following the news of financial irregularities at IndusInd Bank, shareholders have incurred significant losses, and depositors are now facing growing concerns. The primary worry is whether the bank’s financial troubles will affect their deposits and whether the bank’s financial condition will deteriorate further in the future.\nRecent events have highlighted instances where investors were unable to access their deposits due to RBI-imposed restrictions following financial irregularities and regulatory lapses by certain lenders, impacting their financial stability. A notable example is the crisis at Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC Bank), where the RBI restricted depositors from accessing their funds, including fixed deposits, for months due to severe financial issues.\nRecommended Stories\nIndusInd Bank’s Financial Troubles\nIndusInd Bank has been under pressure due to declining asset quality and increased provisioning for several quarters. The private sector bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) stood at 2.24% in September 2024, compared to 1.92% a year earlier. Both its profitability and capital adequacy ratio have also been on a downward trajectory. The latest issue troubling the bank involves “discrepancies\" in some of its portfolios. An internal review has estimated a 2.35% adverse post-tax impact on its net worth as of December 2024. This comes after the RBI instructed banks to conduct a thorough review of their investment portfolios.\nThe IndusInd Bank saga has reignited concerns over the safety of deposits in the banking sector. The financial irregularities at the bank have only heightened depositors’ anxiety about the broader stability of the banking system.\nAre Your Bank Deposits Safe?\nGiven the current situation, the key question for depositors is whether their hard-earned money in banks is truly safe. Fixed deposits (FDs), which have traditionally been seen as a reliable investment, are now facing renewed scrutiny. Will the trust in FDs remain intact amid such concerns?\nToday, safety is a top priority for investors, and for decades, bank FDs have been considered stable and dependable. With fixed returns and minimal risk, FDs have long been the go-to choice for risk-averse investors. But are FDs still as secure as they once were? Let’s explore their benefits and security in more detail.\nWhy Are Fixed Deposits Considered Safe?\nThree key reasons drive people to choose fixed deposits—safety, liquidity, and easy access:\n- Safety and Stability: FDs protect your money from market volatility. They are unaffected by stock market fluctuations or changes in interest rates, making them ideal for those who prefer to avoid risk.\n- Liquidity Advantage: FDs offer relatively easy access to funds. While premature withdrawals may incur penalties, this option remains available—something not offered by many other investment types.\n- Guaranteed Returns: Unlike the fluctuating stock market or other investment instruments, FDs offer predetermined returns. This allows investors to know in advance the amount they will receive at maturity.\nAre FDs Still a Safe Option?\nIf safety is your primary concern, fixed deposits can still be a great investment choice, provided you select a stable and reliable bank.\nGovernment Considers Raising Bank Deposit Insurance Cover\nIn response to concerns among depositors, reports indicate that the government is considering increasing the deposit insurance cover from Rs 5 lakh. This move is expected to boost confidence in the banking system, particularly among senior citizens and general depositors. However, such an increase may require the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) to slightly raise its premium charges.", "text_len": 3970}

The US dollar index surged amid tariff-related uncertainty, driving capital outflows from emerging markets and adding pressure on their currencies. Global CPI inflation declined to 5.7 percent in 2024, a 100-basis-point drop from the previous year.\nWhile inflation in advanced economies eased significantly, services inflation remained sticky. Japan is expected to raise rates, while the US maintains a steady stance and Europe explores rate cuts. Key emerging markets such as India and Mexico reduced rates to support growth, while Brazil increased its policy rate by 100 basis points to control inflation.\nEmerging themes in markets\nThree key trends are shaping global markets in 2025.\nAlso read | Momentum versus value: Finding the balance in risk-conscious investing\nFirstly, the Magnificent 7 stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla — have shown signs of slowing down, underperforming the broader market as investor focus shifts to broader equity exposure.\nSecondly, European equities are outperforming US stocks this year, driven by value recovery and improved economic conditions.\nLastly, US Treasury yields have declined due to softer inflation data and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts.

Bonds continue to be a strong hedge against a potential slowdown, which appears increasingly likely due to policy uncertainty.\nIndia outlook\nIndia’s economic recovery continues to gain strength, supported by positive high-frequency data. E-way bill growth surged to 23.1 percent in January 2025, reflecting improved business activity. Toll collections rose significantly in both volume and value terms. Wholesale automobile sales grew 2.5 percent year on year in January after two months of contraction. The two-wheeler segment recovered strongly, led by higher scooter demand, while tractor sales posted double-digit growth for the second consecutive month. Vehicle registrations also improved across transport and non-transport segments.\nThe Union Budget 2025-26 emphasises fiscal consolidation, with the fiscal deficit targeted at 4.4 percent of GDP in FY26, down from 4.8 percent in FY25. Capital expenditure is projected to increase by 10.1 percent, focusing on infrastructure, manufacturing, and industrial expansion.\nInflation eased to a five-month low of 4.3 percent in January 2025, while core inflation increased slightly to 3.7 percent. The RBI cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent to stimulate growth. The RBI’s liquidity-enhancing measures, including a $10 billion dollar/rupee swap and variable rate repo auctions, have helped stabilise the financial system. Forex reserves remain robust at $640 billion, covering over ten months of imports.\nOn the external front, India’s current account deficit (CAD) improved to 1.2 percent of GDP in Q2 2024-25, down from 1.3 percent a year earlier. Remittance inflows reached $129.1 billion, reinforcing India’s position as the world’s top remittance recipient.

Investors are encouraged to accumulate quality large-cap and mid-cap stocks over the next 3–4 months and stay patient for potential rewards over the coming years. The constructive outlook on equities is supported by two key drivers: the Union Budget’s focus on fiscal discipline and capex momentum, and the RBI’s pivot toward supporting growth through liquidity infusions and rate cuts.\nIn the ongoing accumulation phase, investors may focus on sectors that are relatively insulated from external risks, alongside those with strong export-driven prospects. PSUs, Infrastructure, and Industrials are emerging as promising sectors, while Consumption, IT, Pharma, and Private Banks/NBFCs remain stable investment themes.\nThe Indian bond market also stands to benefit from the government's disciplined fiscal consolidation path and the RBI’s renewed focus on liquidity management. The fiscal deficit target of 4.4 percent for FY26, coupled with a stable net borrowing program, enhances the bond market's outlook. AAA-rated corporate bonds with 2–3-year durations currently offer yields exceeding 7.35 percent, creating attractive investment opportunities for stable returns.

Cooling inflation and rate cut bets may add to India’s celebrations\nIndia celebrates Holi against a backdrop of easing retail inflation at a seven-month low of 3.61% and recent RBI repo rate cuts, providing relief to loan borrowers. Manufacturing growth and significant tax cuts in the Union Budget further boost economic activity. The upcoming wage revision for government employees is expected to increase savings and consumption, fueling further economic expansion.\nColours? check, sweets? check...robust economy? check.\nAs you continue to gather your gulal and stock up on sweets, there is another reason to celebrate Holi this year—the Indian economy is bringing its own splash of colors to the festival.\nWith inflation cooling, EMIs likely to get cheaper, and a fresh dose of tax relief from the government, there’s more than just festive spirit in the air.\nSo, as you vibe on “Balam Pichkari\" or \"Do me a favor, let’s play Holi!”—here’s how the economy is setting the perfect backdrop for a vibrant, cheerful celebration.\nCooling prices leading to warm smiles\nThis Holi, there’s good news straight from your kitchen—sweets and festive treats might be a bit lighter on your pockets this time around.\nIndia’s retail inflation cooled to a seven-month low of 3.61% in February, down from 4.31% in January. And what's the reason? A significant drop in food inflation, which makes up a major chunk of the consumer price index basket (used to calculate retail inflation).\nThe food inflation saw a significant decline from 5.97% to 3.75% in February, with essential Holi staples like cereals and dairy seeing price dips.\nCereal inflation eased to 6.10% from 6.24%, while milk and dairy products fell to 2.68% from 2.85%. So, whether it’s gujiyas, malpuas, or thandai, expect your festive feast to taste just as sweet!\nIn January, the Economic Survey for 2024-25, released by the government, had projected that food inflation would ease in the final quarter of FY25, and this cooling trend only adds to the festive cheer.\nColourful days for borrowers\nAhead of blue, green, red and other colours taking over the streets, the RBI had given homebuyers and borrowers something to cheer about—cheaper EMIs could be coming soon! In a move that marks the first rate cut in five years, the RBI-led MPC reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%.\nFor home loan borrowers, this is a game-changer. After years of watching interest rates either rise or remain stagnant, they may finally see lenders lowering rates on floating home loans. Lower EMIs mean more breathing room for household budgets, making homeownership a little more affordable amid rising property prices.\nExperts predict that this is just the beginning. The SBI Research Ecowrap report suggests that the RBI could go for a cumulative rate cut of 75 basis points this fiscal, with back-to-back reductions expected in April and June 2025, followed by another potential cut in October.\nWith inflation expected to average 4.7% in FY25 and remain between 4.0-4.2% in FY26, analysts believe the RBI has room to continue its rate-cutting spree. If these predictions hold, we could see a revival in spending, investment, and overall economic momentum.\nManufacturing: The engine that’s picking up the pace\nHoli isn’t just about colors—it’s about energy, momentum, and the excitement of the festival. And India’s industrial sector is mirroring that spirit head on.\nIndustrial production growth accelerated to 5% in January, driven majorly by manufacturing, as per the data shared by the government. At least 19 out of 23 manufacturing industries recorded positive momentum, a significant improvement from the previous month’s tally of 16.\nHigher government spending in January provided further support, boosting industries like petroleum products (which saw an 8.5% year-on-year growth), capital goods (7.8% YoY growth), and consumer durables (7.2% YoY growth). Strong performances in infrastructure and construction goods also point to a robust economic outlook.\nWith resilient rural demand and rising non-oil exports, the industrial sector is gearing up for steady growth—just in time to add more energy to the festival of colors.\nSitharaman’s sweet surprise\nThe month of February started with a Holi-like splash of good news—Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced significant tax relief in the Union Budget 2025-26. Under the new tax regime, incomes up to Rs 12 lakh are now tax-free, a move that is expected to put more money in the hands of middle-class Indians.\nMoody’s Ratings predicted that this tax relief will boost consumption, a much-needed push after months of cautious spending. Private consumption, which accounts for nearly 60% of India’s GDP, has been under pressure due to high inflation and slow wage growth.\nWith more disposable income, consumer sentiment is expected to improve, leading to increased spending on everything from essentials to aspirational purchases. Industry leaders, including Godrej Consumer Products’ CFO Aasif Malbari, believe this will fuel demand across multiple sectors.\nThe government estimates that 25-30 million taxpayers will benefit from these tax cuts, saving approximately Rs 1,00,000 annually. More savings mean more spending power—good news for businesses and consumers alike.\nRs 50 bn boost from wage hikes\nIf you thought the economic cheer stops at tax cuts, think again! A fresh wave of spending and savings could be on the horizon as India prepares for a significant wage revision under the 8th Central Pay Commission in January 2026.\nThis revision will impact around 3.1 crore people—1.8 crore government employees and 1.3 crore pensioners—adding an estimated $50 billion to the economy. While much of this boost is expected to go into savings, some of it will likely fuel consumption, keeping the economic engine running smoothly.\nUBS predicted that the upcoming hike will be in the range of 15-20%, lower than the 24% increase in the last cycle but still substantial enough to influence spending patterns. The final percentage hike will depend on the fitment factor, a crucial multiplier that determines salary revisions.\nWhile a higher wage hike (20-25%) could temporarily boost GDP, an excessively steep increase (40-45%) might have inflationary effects, leading to an RBI rate hike. The government will likely strike a balance, ensuring macroeconomic stability while keeping consumer sentiment upbeat.\nTrump's tariff threats may spoil the fun\nAmid all these cheers, there's one thing that may play a spoilsport i.e. Donald Trump's tariff threats. Last week, Trump attacked India's tariffs, saying it is \"next to impossible to sell anything to India\" because of the \"high tariffs.\"\nIn a nationally televised address, Trump focused on the tariffs his administration will be putting in effect soon. However, he also revealed that India has agreed to slash its tariffs significantly, allegedly because \"somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.\"\nIn his remarks at the White House, ANI quoted Trump as saying, \"India charges us massive tariffs. Massive. You can't even sell anything in India...They have agreed, by the way; they want to cut their tariffs way down now because somebody is finally exposing them for what they have done.\"\nIndia's exports are already feeling the pressure of former US President Donald Trump’s proposed reciprocal tariffs, set to take effect on April 2. These tariffs aim to match the import duties imposed by US trading partners, potentially hitting India hard due to its higher tariff structure.\nAnalysts estimate that India could face a loss of up to $7 billion annually if the US proceeds with tariff hikes of 4-6 percentage points. India exported nearly $74 billion worth of goods to the US in 2024, with key sectors like jewelry, pharmaceuticals, and petrochemicals being vulnerable.\nWhile immediate relief remains uncertain, India is actively working to navigate the challenges posed by Trump's tariff policies.\nHowever, factors like easing inflation and tax relief to potential rate cuts and wage hikes are likely to paint the economic landscape vibrantly.\nAs you continue to gather your gulal and stock up on sweets, there is another reason to celebrate Holi this year—the Indian economy is bringing its own splash of colors to the festival.\nWith inflation cooling, EMIs likely to get cheaper, and a fresh dose of tax relief from the government, there’s more than just festive spirit in the air.\nSo, as you vibe on “Balam Pichkari\" or \"Do me a favor, let’s play Holi!”—here’s how the economy is setting the perfect backdrop for a vibrant, cheerful celebration.\nCooling prices leading to warm smiles\nThis Holi, there’s good news straight from your kitchen—sweets and festive treats might be a bit lighter on your pockets this time around. India’s retail inflation cooled to a seven-month low of 3.61% in February, down from 4.31% in January. And what's the reason? A significant drop in food inflation, which makes up a major chunk of the consumer price index basket (used to calculate retail inflation).\nThe food inflation saw a significant decline from 5.97% to 3.75% in February, with essential Holi staples like cereals and dairy seeing price dips.\nCereal inflation eased to 6.10% from 6.24%, while milk and dairy products fell to 2.68% from 2.85%. So, whether it’s gujiyas, malpuas, or thandai, expect your festive feast to taste just as sweet!\nIn January, the Economic Survey for 2024-25, released by the government, had projected that food inflation would ease in the final quarter of FY25, and this cooling trend only adds to the festive cheer.\nColourful days for borrowers\nAhead of blue, green, red and other colours taking over the streets, the RBI had given homebuyers and borrowers something to cheer about—cheaper EMIs could be coming soon! In a move that marks the first rate cut in five years, the RBI-led MPC reduced the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%.For home loan borrowers, this is a game-changer. After years of watching interest rates either rise or remain stagnant, they may finally see lenders lowering rates on floating home loans. Lower EMIs mean more breathing room for household budgets, making homeownership a little more affordable amid rising property prices.\nExperts predict that this is just the beginning. The SBI Research Ecowrap report suggests that the RBI could go for a cumulative rate cut of 75 basis points this fiscal, with back-to-back reductions expected in April and June 2025, followed by another potential cut in October.\nWith inflation expected to average 4.7% in FY25 and remain between 4.0-4.2% in FY26, analysts believe the RBI has room to continue its rate-cutting spree. If these predictions hold, we could see a revival in spending, investment, and overall economic momentum.\nManufacturing: The engine that’s picking up the pace\nHoli isn’t just about colors—it’s about energy, momentum, and the excitement of the festival. And India’s industrial sector is mirroring that spirit head on.Industrial production growth accelerated to 5% in January, driven majorly by manufacturing, as per the data shared by the government. At least 19 out of 23 manufacturing industries recorded positive momentum, a significant improvement from the previous month’s tally of 16.\nHigher government spending in January provided further support, boosting industries like petroleum products (which saw an 8.5% year-on-year growth), capital goods (7.8% YoY growth), and consumer durables (7.2% YoY growth). Strong performances in infrastructure and construction goods also point to a robust economic outlook.\nWith resilient rural demand and rising non-oil exports, the industrial sector is gearing up for steady growth—just in time to add more energy to the festival of colors.\nSitharaman’s sweet surprise\nThe month of February started with a Holi-like splash of good news—Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced significant tax relief in the Union Budget 2025-26.

Mule accounts at Indian crypto exchanges, through the use of VPN , were receiving \"high volume\" deposits from un-hosted and offshore exchanges apart from the laundering of cybercrime funds.\nThe federal agency also stated in its trend report about the suspicion of \"high-volume\" cryptocurrency, hawala and online gaming-related transactions by persons based in \"sensitive\" regions allegedly for terrorist and secessionist activities, money laundering through cryptocurrency by persons of origin from \"sensitive\" foreign countries apart from the existence of \"illegal\" and \"unregistered\" online Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers or crypto exchanges.\nThe presence of some 'pump and dump' schemes involving fake coin and crypto tokens, \"high volume\" of crypto transactions involved in running \"illegal\" forex applications apart from attempts to onboard persons suspected to be involved in unlawful activities in \"sensitive regions\" were also among the suspicions reported by the trends study.\nThe report concluded that based on these trends and patterns, it can be said that VDAs like Bitcoin, Tron and Stable coins are very \"widely\" used by \"illicit actors\" because of their widespread acceptability and stability in value.\nIn most of the cases, offshore VDA service providers and un-hosted/un-identified wallets were being used to launder the proceeds of crime, the analysis found.\n\"It is reiterated that the trends based on operational analysis carried out are based only on suspicion. The credible intelligence was shared with law enforcement agencies and necessary enforcement action has been taken by law enforcement agencies in some cases,\" it said.\nThe report underlined that the cryptocurrency landscape in India has been \"rapidly\" evolving and gaining \"popularity\" among investors and traders.\nThe VDAs have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to transform the financial sector and provide new opportunities for wealth creation, it stated.\nKeeping in view the challenges and risks posed by cryptocurrencies particularly with respect to money laundering and terrorist financing, India, in March 2023, brought out a regime where all crypto exchanges were required to register as reporting entities with the FIU and share suspicious transaction reports with the agency under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act .\nDuring the same time, all other reporting entities like private and public sector banks, capital market intermediaries, non-banking financial companies, insurance entities and credit card operators among others were asked to \"monitor\" and share reports of all crypto transactions and customers in their respective channels with the FIU.\nThe Central Economic Intelligence Bureau , another agency under the Union finance ministry like the FIU, has also submitted a report on VDAs to the government in 2023 recommending a regulator for the crypto sector in the country.\nThis article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.", "text_len": 4950}

In the recent fall, we are seeing bigger cuts among SMIDs. Are we done with most of the pain? Or could there be some more corrections even from these levels?\nJitendra Sriram: Firstly, I would say that we had a little bit of a derating from October onwards because our earnings momentum was a little lower than what was anticipated at the beginning of the year, largely because of economic growth numbers. If you look at the second quarter GDP 5.6% odd was a little lower than what the market was expecting. But having said that, a large part of the derating that you talk about is behind us.\nWe used to trade at a substantial premium to MSCI World Index, and also to the MSCI EM Index and a lot of that froth has now drained out. It is impossible to time or say this is the bottom or something, but give or take a band of 5% to 10%. We are broadly where a lot of the froth has gotten out and also from a government perspective, we are seeing material action starting to come through.\nSo, first, there is a step up in capex in terms of how the January capex has come through, etc. Second, what the RBI is doing in terms of infusing liquidity into the market through the VRR mechanism, the swaps, etc. Last year, there was an effective monetary tightening because we were fighting inflation post the Russia-Ukraine issue and fiscal tightening because the government was also not spending enough because of the electoral dynamics. Now fiscal spending is picking up.\nWe are seeing both levers starting to play out for the market. Net-net, we are seeing some of the platforms for FY26 being a lot more favourable now than what it was last year.\nWould it be fair to say that given the way the churn is happening in the market, in banking counters, the valuations have gotten pretty reasonable. Would you go all out for banks at this point in time?\nJitendra Sriram: Yes, I would say that the banking sector is definitely looking far more interesting because we do not have the froth of excessive performance on the back of some of these private banks. And now in a situation where valuations have become a lot more reasonable, it is looking a lot more interesting going forward, especially with the monetary ammunition that is coming forth from the RBI.\nThere are certain other things that are parallelly happening, and so you may have a little bit of softness come through on certain other segments of the market, especially the capital market segments, etc. You are seeing some slowdown in QIPs, IPOs, all that kind of thing, which is positive from a secondary market perspective, but it will obviously hurt some of the names in the capital market space because that fees will no longer be as buoyant as what it used to be. So, within the space, we have a lot more preference for the banking names itself compared to, say, segments like capital markets, etc.\nJitendra Sriram: From a re-rating candidate perspective, clearly there is this entire segment of quick commerce or the areas of this consumer services, which is now coming to a stage wherein from a cash burn situation, they are now moving to a cash generation scenario, so that is something that we clearly see as a key inflection point for a re-rating there.\nSecond, the private banks themselves, because of the fact that the business has shifted, there is obviously the consumption levers which will come forth because of whatever was announced in the budgets coming from April onwards, so those will also be levers. So, these are certainly areas that look like potential candidates for re-rating.\nOn the derating side, we have seen a lot of states do more towards consumption-oriented spending than capex. So, one area which could be potentially vulnerable is segments of capital goods that were exposed to state spending could be an area of pain. Capital markets, I already mentioned that there could be a little bit of hiccup there going forward. So, those are areas that are potentially derating segments.\nWhat is your view coming in on the earnings because for the last two quarters, earnings have not been good. Come Q4, things do not seem to be that pretty either because you have a lot of brokers already pencilling in and the earnings downgrade cycle is actually kick-starting for corporate India. What is your view on the earnings cycle? Where do you see that headed going ahead?\nJitendra Sriram: I would beg to differ on the way we look at earnings. I would say that on a YoY basis, you are probably right in what you say that maybe we may have a flattish to a small growth going forward, but where the platform is being created is that on a sequential basis from third quarter into fourth quarter, you will probably start seeing a better perk up in growth going forward because of all the spending, monetary easing that is going on and all that, that will help the markets overall.\nThe other sector I want to touch upon is the metal pack. Though from the start of this year, Nifty has been very volatile and has seen a lot of corrections, the metal index has outperformed Nifty with 15-20% on percentage terms. Do you believe it is still a sector to be in and in the short term that is expected to do good or maybe look out for some other sectors since the sector churning is at play?\nJitendra Sriram: Metals is a very interesting shift happening, which is that we tend to underestimate some of the initiatives that China is doing. Apart from the reiterating of a 5% GDP growth on that base in the National People's Congress, what has happened is that there is also a lot of infusion of capital because of the stimulus that they announced in September last year, almost 5% of GDP.\nSo, it is going into provincial governments, it is going into recapitalising the banking system, etc. The metal segment is showing some signs of life back again. Also, remember that most of the prices are dollar linked. So, to an extent, metals could have some more legs to run. Now with Europe talking about upping their defence spending, you could have another tailwind for the metal space coming from there as well.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

With inflation near tolerance zone and most of the negatives priced in and major part of earnings downgrades behind, the focus of market participants will shift towards growth, said Devang Mehta who has 23 years of experience in wealth management, investment advisory, equity research, equity sales & portfolio management.\nDo you expect the RBI to deliver another 25 bps cut in the repo rate during the April policy meeting, especially after reviewing inflation numbers, growth data, and global cues?\nIndia’s Consumer Price Index inflation eased to 3.6 percent year-on-year (YoY) in February, marking its lowest level since July 2024. The latest inflation figure came in below market expectations of 4 percent and well below January’s 4.3 percent. As RBI embarks upon the rate cut cycle, it can be expected that more cuts are also on the cards, while the timing can be debatable. Cumulatively, there can be 75bps cut in this calendar year. RBI is likely to cut interest rates by 25 bps in April.\nDo you think the market focus has shifted to growth rather than inflation now?\nFocus of government to boost capex post a slowdown in the last couple of quarters seem evident and also the undertone of the Union Budget to support consumption by way of tax saving are couple of growth-oriented positives. So far markets have ignored all positive news flow and have increased its sensitivity to negative news. With inflation near tolerance zone and most of the negatives priced in and major part of earnings downgrades behind us, the focus of market participants will shift towards growth.\nWhich sectors are still in risk mode, and could bring further downside in the equity markets?\nAny sector with very high global dependence can bring in a bit of uncomfortable tilt to the portfolio as narratives nowadays change by minutes and hours. Apart from this, the focus has to be on checking the fundamentals and carrying out a lot of due diligence on management quality of individual companies. Franchisees where there is high debt, only story without numbers, absence of robust earnings growth, no free or operating cash flows are obvious red flags.\nWhich pockets are presenting attractive investment opportunities after the equity market turmoil?\nIndia’s investment and capex cycle is likely to benefit sectors like Infra, manufacturing, capital goods, power automation, air solutions. Robust government and bank balance sheets will ensure a strong pipeline of projects in utilities, renewables and manufacturing.\nRecovery in consumption trends across rural & Urban India will drive sectors like hotels, hospitality, tourism, luxury and higher end consumption related businesses.\nCan the US markets fall another 10% from here, considering the rising recession fears?\nAfter the huge run up in US markets, some valuation parameters like P/E ratios or equity risk premiums are now expensive. Also, the narratives in the new regime along with geopolitical tensions have the potential to infuse added volatility into the markets. Gravity has to come to the proceedings and some more correction can’t be ruled out.\nDo you expect further drop in equity mutual fund inflows in coming months, considering the market volatility and global growth concerns?\nThe escalation in global trade tensions triggered a risk-off, weighing on investor sentiments. Geopolitical tensions, slower domestic earnings growth, relentless profit booking and continued FII outflows didn’t augur well for the markets.\nWhile short-term headwinds have tempered investment flows, domestically, investor confidence remains strong, as indicated by continued inflows for most part of this volatile ride. Investors are adopting a cautious yet steady approach, reassessing their portfolios while maintaining long-term investment commitments.\nIts imperative to note that volatility will be the only constant which will time and again urge you to stop investing but the power of patience, persistence and discipline will lead to continual wealth creation over the longer term.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Panda’s tenure is scheduled to end on Thursday.\nHis big moves — capping premium hikes for senior citizen health policies at 10%, increasing surrender value for holders unhappy with their policies and reducing the eligibility criterion from two years to one — have forced the industry to review business models. Following the rollout of these decisions, life insurers have cut first-year commissions on new policies and clawed back to overall commission payouts. The fallout has been an overall de-growth for the industry in terms of premium collections.\nThese moves come against the backdrop of India’s historically low insurance penetration — 2.8% in life and 1% in non-life as of 2023. With the industry already grappling with the Budget’s push towards the new tax regime that will not give any benefits to taxpayers for buying insurance, Panda’s moves have forced the industry to re-strategise to attract potential customers and devising business models.\nOf course, there was a pushback from both general and life insurance companies. While the former complained about rising healthcare inflation and claims, the latter wasn’t happy with the pressure on them to pay higher amounts. But Panda stuck to his guns.\nIndustry experts say that the pressure to make higher payouts will significantly reduce mis-selling as there will be little incentive in terms of commissions.\nPanda also targeted the ills in the banking system that have often led to mis-selling of products. A few months ago, speaking at the State Bank of India’s Annual Business & Economic Conclave, Panda said, “…the bank channel is a very useful channel, but of late, a lot of ills have crept into the system”.\nHe went on to add that banks should become a distribution model which is low cost. “You don’t need to chase customers. You have to give the option to the customers. No mis-selling, no force-selling…”\nWhile the sector is still adjusting to these sweeping policy changes, the road ahead is also challenging.\nOne of the most pressing priorities will be the rollout of “Bima Trinity”, Panda’s pet initiative that faced multiple delays and remained unfinished during his tenure. Proposed in 2022, Bima Trinity is an ambitious plan to create an Amazon-like digital platform for insurance sales, servicing and claims settlement.\nThe project comprises three key elements: Bima Sugam (a digital marketplace), Bima Vistaar (a composite insurance product) and Bima Vahaak (a women-led insurance distribution model). Despite its significance, the initiative has been postponed multiple times — first from January 2023 to June 2024, then to August 2024, and most recently, to mid-2025.\nAll three components are now in the final stages of implementation. For instance, after extensive discussions, industry players have finalised the product model for Bima Vistaar, India’s first composite insurance policy covering death, personal accident, property and surgical hospitalisation.\nThe Bima Vahaak portal is nearing completion, with a soft launch planned in April 2025 to onboard Vahaks (women-led distributors).\nBeyond Bima Trinity, the transition to a risk-based capital (RBC) framework and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will be major regulatory developments.\nIndustry insiders credit Panda with championing the government’s “insurance for all by 2047” vision and advocating for increased foreign participation to spur competition and innovation. He was an ardent proponent of raising the foreign direct investment limit from 74% to 100%.\nUnder Panda’s leadership, Irdai streamlined 78 regulations into 20, with only 15 directly governing insurance operations. “Panda was as much a technocrat as he was a bureaucrat,” says a senior executive at a private insurer. Panda championed initiatives like the regulatory sandbox and extended the “use and file” procedure across life, general, and health insurance. The “use and file” framework enabled the rollout of products like “pay-as-you-drive” motor insurance and unlimited-claim health policies.\nWhile Panda was able to implement a risk-based capital framework, he was unable to convince legacy insurers on public listing. The challenge for the regulator will be to strike a balance — encouraging public listings while addressing industry concerns.\nFor the financial sector, these are interesting times. With both the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board of India being led by new faces, all eyes are on Irdai now.", "text_len": 4629}

The decline was largely driven by lower food prices, with food inflation—comprising nearly half of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket—falling to 3.75% in February from 5.97% in January.\"The WPI inflation inched up marginally to 2.4% in February 2025 from 2.3% in January 2025, while printing largely in line with ICRA’s expectations (+2.3%).

The central bank expects inflation to moderate further in the fiscal year 2025-26, providing relief to Indian households.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), under the leadership of new Governor Sanjay Malhotra, is tasked with keeping inflation within the target range of 2-6%. For FY26, the central bank has projected an overall inflation rate of 4.2%. The inflation projections for the four quarters of FY26 are as follows: Q1 at 4.5%, Q2 at 4.0%, Q3 at 3.8%, and Q4 at 4.2%.\nMalhotra highlighted that inflation had eased from a peak of 6.2% in October 2024, declining steadily in November and December due to falling vegetable prices. For FY25, the RBI expects CPI inflation to average 4.8%, with further moderation anticipated in FY26, assuming normal monsoon conditions.\nEconomic Survey and inflation risks\nThe Economic Survey for 2024-25, released earlier in January, projected that food inflation would soften in the final quarter of FY25.

In just two years, complaints sent to RBI (after banks ignored them) have grown 50% every year. If India’s economy grew that fast, it would become bigger than the U.S. in just five years!\nThe problem is worse than it seems.

That’s against the rules.\nWhat’s Going Wrong?\nIn the past, banking complaints were mostly about mistakes in records or forged documents. But now, problems are more complex:\n- A man in Gujarat lost his credit score because of a bank’s mistake, making it impossible for him to get a loan.\n- Banks trick people into buying investment plans or insurance instead of just helping with banking.\n- Banks are not careful enough with loans—they’ve been warned about gold loans, unsecured loans, and top-up loans.\n- The Supreme Court (SC) is looking into a scam between banks and builders. Some home buyers have been paying EMIs for homes that don’t even exist yet! SC asked: “How did you release 60% of the loan when not even a single brick was laid?”\nBanks Must Listen\nRBI has warned banks: if they don’t fix these issues, people will stop trusting them.

The weighted average call rate (WACR) reached a high of 6.81% in January before dropping to 6.21% on March 12. Typically, the WACR operates within a corridor, with the repo rate (6.25%) as the ceiling and the reverse repo rate as the floor.\nThe three-month CD rate also rose by 25-30 basis points in December.\nThe RBI has already infused ₹4.1 lakh crore of liquidity into the market through open market operation purchases (OMO). Another ₹1 lakh crore of OMO purchases are to be held through two auctions in March.\nThere were $15.16 billion of dollar/rupee buy/sell swaps auctioned, and another $10 billion buy/sell swaps have been announced for auctions in March 2025. As per India Ratings, the aggregate infusion of rupee liquidity through swaps could be around ₹2.15 lakh crore by the next quarter.\nThe overall infusion of around ₹4.5 lakh crore of rupee liquidity is likely to shift the banking system liquidity into the surplus territory. Along with the current measures, a dividend transfer from the RBI to the government will add to the rupee liquidity in the system and further boost the system liquidity, the rating agency noted.\n\"The RBI is also likely to maintain adequate liquidity in the system through various tools, while banks' liquidity will remain sufficient thanks to existing statutory liquidity and cash reserve requirements,\" said Amit Pandey, vice president and senior analyst at Moody's Ratings. \"Net interest margins will decline marginally as banks reflect policy rate cuts in loan rates before repricing deposits.\"\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 2811}

The overall macroeconomic environment is improving with increased government spending and RBI's measures to ease liquidity constraints.\nThe central bank's recent risk weight reduction on bank lending to NBFCs signals a constructive approach, which should enhance funding access, particularly for smaller NBFCs.\nAdditionally, a recent 25-basis-point interest rate cut, along with potential future cuts, is expected to support net interest margins (NIMs) across the sector.\nThe asset quality (AQ) of NBFCs is showing stabilization across key segments. Collections have improved in recent months, and while gross non-performing assets (GNPA) may rise slightly in Q1 FY26, the increase is expected to be lower than last year.\nHowever, the microfinance institution (MFI) segment remains under stress, particularly in Karnataka, where a microfinance ordinance impacted collection efficiency.\nDespite some improvements in other states, the transition to MFIN 2.0 regulations in April 2025 could add further pressure to the MFI segment.\nHowever, spillover effects from unsecured MFI loans to secured loan products remain limited. NBFC exposure to MFI overlaps is highest in gold loans (9 per cent), small-ticket loans like micro LAP/PL (6-7 per cent), affordable housing (4-5 per cent), and two-wheeler loans (2 per cent), while commercial vehicle (CV) loans remain largely unaffected.\nThe vehicle financing sector is experiencing mixed trends. Demand for light commercial vehicles (LCVs) is improving, while medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCVs) continue to face muted demand and rising competition.\nThe affordable housing finance sector (AHFCs) is witnessing steady disbursements, though some pricing pressure is emerging due to aggressive competition from larger players.\nPost-RBI's 25bps rate cut, PSU banks have lowered home loan rates to 8.1-8.2 per cent, but private banks have yet to follow suit.\nLarger housing finance companies (HFCs) with fixed liabilities may experience NIM pressure, making AHFCs a preferred choice due to their better pricing power. Among AHFCs, Home First Finance remains a top pick.\nWhile NBFC stocks have declined 3-41 per cent from their six-month peaks, top large retail and auto-focused NBFCs have outperformed the broader market.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 2750}

Banking system liquidity is expected to remain in surplus, corporate bond and certificate of deposit (CD) issuance is likely to decline due to an economic slowdown and delays in implementing Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) guidelines, all tailwinds that improve prospects for corporate bonds.\nIn addition, the fund house also stated that valuations for short-term corporate bonds appear attractive.\nFrom a risk-reward perspective, Axis MF believes that short-term bonds could outperform long bonds in the near term.\nTheir thesis is based on the likelihood of a shallower rate cut cycle given the ongoing economic recovery and external uncertainties such as tariffs and currency fluctuations. Moreover, the pace of RBI’s open market operations (OMO) purchases is likely to slow in the second half of the year, with an estimated Rs 1-1.5 lakh crore in additional purchases expected in the next fiscal year.\nFurthermore, with the government shifting its fiscal focus from deficit reduction to managing the debt-to-GDP ratio, the scope for further fiscal consolidation appears limited, the fund house believes.\nConsidering these factors, Axis MF anticipate short-term corporate bonds (3-5 years) to perform at least as well as, if not better than, long-duration bonds. The combination of a shallow rate-cut cycle and favourable liquidity conditions reinforces the case for increasing exposure to short-duration corporate bonds in investment portfolios, the firm said.\nAs for long-term government bonds, Axis MF had maintained a positive outlook throughout 2024, largely backed by favourable demand-supply dynamics. The inclusion of Indian government bonds in JP Morgan indices attracted around $20 billion in foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows.\nAdditionally, fiscal consolidation efforts over the past two years have successfully reduced the fiscal deficit from 5.4 percent to 4.4 percent of GDP. The RBI further addressed liquidity concerns by conducting over Rs 2.5 lakh crore in OMOs, including secondary purchases, in the first quarter of 2025.\nDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

With the final redemption price of Rs 8,634 per gram, investors have made an impressive 193% return over eight years, excluding the interest component.\nIn addition to capital appreciation, SGB holders also earned a fixed 2.50% annual interest, paid semi-annually (without compounding).\nOne of the key advantages of SGBs is that they are exempt from capital gains tax if held until maturity. This means that the entire appreciation in value is tax-free for investors.\nCalculation of final redemption priceThe final redemption price of Rs 8,634 per gram was determined by calculating the average closing price of gold during the period from March 10 to March 13, 2025, excluding the March 14, 2025 holiday.\nWhat are Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)?Sovereign Gold Bonds are government securities issued by the RBI on behalf of the Indian government.

Eligible investors include individuals, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), trusts, universities, and charitable institutions. Even if an individual changes their residential status from resident to non-resident, they can continue to hold SGBs until early redemption or maturity.\nSGBs are sold through various authorized agencies, including nationalized banks, scheduled private banks, scheduled foreign banks, designated post offices, the Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd. (SHCIL), and stock exchanges, either directly or through their agents.\nRedemption process for SGBsOne month before maturity, investors will be notified about the upcoming redemption.

The due date of premature redemption of the above tranche has been fixed on March 17, 2025, a Thursday release by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said.\nThe redemption price for premature redemption is Rs 8,634 per gram based on the simple average of closing gold price for the three business days i.e., March 11, March 12, and March 13, 2025.\nSGBs are government securities denominated in grams of gold. The bonds are redeemed in cash on maturity. The SGB is issued by the RBI on behalf of the Government of India and it carries a sovereign guarantee. It can be purchased when RBI comes out with an issue.\nThe advantage of SGB over other forms of Gold is on multiple counts. Apart from capital appreciation, SGBs offer a 2.5% interest on the capital appreciation, Personal Finance expert Jitendra Solanki. There is no capital gains tax if one remains invested for 8 years, he added. SGBs are highly liquid and are traded on the exchanges, Solanki further said. There is a sovereign guarantee and no danger of a default. Moreover, there is no expense on managing it, the expert said.\nThe last SGB issue opened to the public for subscription was on February 12, 2024, and it closed on February 16, 2024. The SGB scheme was announced as a part of the Union Budget 2015-16.\nGold has been on fire as it hit a fresh life time high of Rs 88,310 per 10 gram on Friday.

The number of complaints under the RBI’s Integrated Ombudsman Scheme has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 50% over the past two years. Worse, 57% of the maintainable complaints last year required mediation or formal intervention by the RBI ombudsmen. No wonder, the governor had to remind bankers at a recent event that it’s not fair to treat customer complaints as a nuisance. The number of complaints could actually be much higher because there is a large section of people who don’t have the wherewithal or aren’t even aware of the processes to make complaints — something that the regulator, along with the industry, needs to address urgently. In fact, one simply has to browse through social media to see the large number of complaints against leading banks. These include repeated demand for know your customer (KYC) documents, and of course, mis-selling of products. And, as the RBI governor rightly pointed out, though all changes in address gets updated in the Central KYC Registry, most banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have not enabled the same in their branches, leading to further harassment of customers.\nAs far as mis-selling goes, it is not just the RBI; even the insurance regulator and the finance minister have warned the industry during the past year. Former Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India chairperson Debasish Panda said a few months back that banks are a very useful channel, but a lot of ills had crept into the system. “You have to give the option to the customer. No mis-selling, no force-selling…,” he had added. In the race to add customers, especially through the online route, many seem to have lost the plot. More customers also mean more grievances — something that the financial sector needs to take into account. What is worrying is the reduction in the number of employees in public sector banks. While the government claims that 95% of the sanctioned clerical and subordinate positions have been filled, employee unions say banks are relying more on temporary workforce due to a manifold rise in workload. According to data, the clerical workforce between 2013 and 2024 shrank by 150,000. Private sector banks score here, as the number of employees has risen from 170,000 to 846,000 between 2011 and 2024.\nThere is no doubt that the workload of the banking sector has risen significantly, especially due to the government’s two grand projects in the past decade — demonetisation and the Jan Dhan Yojana, which has a whopping 530 million account holders. Currently, the sector is grappling with re-KYC of accounts that were opened in 2014-2015. The race to add customers and increase balance sheet sizes has also led to non-adherence to RBI regulations. Even leading banks and NBFCs have erred and received a rap on the knuckles from the banking regulator. At a time when the government and the central bank are working overtime to increase financial inclusion — a good example being the proliferation in the number of Jan Dhan accounts and recent usage of central bank digital currency for government programmes — the banking industry as well as NBFCs and the fintech industry have to treat the customer as a stakeholder, and their complaints as catalysts for improvement. Service quality, after all, is increasingly becoming a key differentiator.", "text_len": 3472}

According to RBI, and as reported by FinancialExpress.com, “there is no need for depositors to react to the speculative reports at this juncture. The bank is well-capitalised and the financial position of the bank remains satisfactory.”\nRBI on IndusInd Bank\nThe IndusInd Bank stock has responded positively to the statement and is seeing significant upmove after the recent correction in the past week. According to RBI, “the bank has already engaged an external audit team to comprehensively review their current systems.” RBI Has directed the Bank’s promoters and the management team to ensure that all ‘remedial action’ is completed by the end of Q4FY25. They have also asked the Bank to make “required disclosures to all stakeholders.”\nCLSA on IndusInd Bank\nWhile most brokerages have a Neutral/Reduce rating on the stock, CLSA has come up with a positive report on the stock. They see potential for 30% upside in the stock price going forward. As reported by FinancialExpress.com, CLSA has put an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 900 per share. According to the international brokerage, while the stock may see some more pain in near-term on account of investor concerns, ‘the bank delivering inline numbers in the subsequent quarters will help allay fears to a large extent.”\nWhat are the positives for IndusInd Bank currently?\nAccording to CLSA, ‘recovery in the microfinance business’ is seen as a key positive for the IndusInd Bank share price at the moment. That apart rate cuts and the RBI’s liquidity boost in the banking system are some of the other key factors that the street is watching out for.\nIndusInd Bank’s capital adequacy is comfortable at the moment, as confirmed by the promoters last week. Its Capital Adequacy Ratio is at 16.46%. The Bank has 70.2% Provision Coverage Ratio as of December 2024. Its Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) stands at 113% as of early March. This exceeds the regulatory requirement of 100%.\nIndusInd Bank Share price Vs Nifty\nThe IndusInd Bank share price is up 4.54% intra-day on March 17 at 9:45 am. This is particularly striking after the share price corrected over 13% in past 5 sessions. Its now down over 33% in 1 month and the stock has corrected over 27% in 2025 so far. We can gauge the extent of the damage when compared to the Benchmark Nifty and the Nifty Bank Index. Over the last 5 das, the Nifty is up nearly 1% and in 2025, the Nifty’s losses are about 5% so far. The 1-month losses for the Nifty is less than 2%. The Nifty Bank Index is up over 1% in last 5 days. This is almost as much as the Nifty Bank Index declined in last 1 month. for 2025, the Nifty Bank Index is down 5%, similar to the Nifty.", "text_len": 2852}

These CDs were priced in the range of 7.80-7.90%, according to data available at Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL).\nAlthough the bank raised money at a slightly higher rate compared with its peers, the fact that it mobilised ₹11,000 crore on a single day indicated that investors have drawn comfort from the RBI's assurance that the \"bank is well-capitalised\" and its financial position \"remains satisfactory\", market experts said.\nThe statement from the RBI came in the backdrop of a 27% fall in the bank's share price Tuesday, a day after the Hinduja Group-promoted lender revealed that accounting lapses in the derivative books could impact its net worth by 2.3% as of December 31, 2024.\nThe fundraising has also allayed investors' concerns about IndusInd's ability to raise funds, given that nearly 50.8% of the promoter's stake has been pledged. The Hinduja Group has a 16.29% stake in the bank.\nThe quantum of CDs raised by IndusInd was more than 40% of the total CDs raised by all banks on Monday. According to CCIL data, banks issued CDs worth ₹27,140 crore on Monday.\nSome other banks may have issued CDs on Monday to raise money to invest in IndusInd's CD, said money market sources.\nIndusInd's one-year CDs were priced at 7.90%, as against 7.62% by Axis Bank for the same maturity, the CCIL data show.\nAlthough the CDs were priced higher, the pertinent issue is that the bank could create a liquidity buffer of ₹11,000 crore in a single day, said the treasury head of private bank. On March 10, the day it disclosed to exchanges about account lapses in the derivatives book, the bank had raised ₹1,850 crore via one-year CDs at 7.75%.\nInterestingly, there were no trades of IndusInd bonds in the secondary market, reflecting investors' preference to invest directly in the primary market.\nOn Saturday, while citing the bank's announcement of hiring an external audit team to review its systems, the RBI directed IndusInd to have remedial actions completed fully during the current quarter after making required disclosures to all stakeholders.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

The UAE’s share during this period declined from 26.9 percent to 19.2 percent.\nSimilarly, the United Kingdom, which just had a 3 percent share in 2016-17, has replaced Saudi Arabia with a 10.9 percent share in 2023-24.\nRemittances are an important source of external funds for India, especially at a time when FDI has slowed.\nIndia’s total remittances jumped to $129 billion in 2024, with a 14.3 percent share of global flows. India received more money than the next two countries combined.\nThere has been a shift in the states receiving the funds as well.\nMaharashtra now tops the list with a 20.5 percent share, replacing Kerala, which had a 19.7 percent share in 2023-24. Tamil Nadu has also gained, while Karnataka, which had a 15 percent share in 2016-17, has declined to 4.4 percent.\nThe study also found that reliance on digital modes has increased, which brings down the cost of transferring funds further.\n“Importantly, on an average, 73.5 percent of total remittances received by the MTOs were through digital mode during 2023-24. This, alongside the lower cost of digital remittances vis-à-vis cash remittances, reflects the significance,” the study noted.\nMoreover, transferring lower amounts (less than $200) was the costliest, with 4.6 percent of rhe total amount, after which the costs halved to 2.4 percent for $200-600.\n“Since the highest number of remittances are sent in lower values, the SDG goal of bringing down the average cost of sending US$ 200 to 3 percent or less by 2030 is critical,” the study noted.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

These forecasts are little changed from the December GEO,” Fitch said in the report.\nFitch’s forecast is an improvement on OECD, which expects 6.4 percent growth in FY26 but lower than the Reserve Bank of India’s projection of 6.7 percent.\nThe economy picked pace, growing 6.2 percent in the third quarter of the fiscal, recovering from a near two-year low of 5.6 percent in the July-September period.\n“We do not think that this soft patch will translate into a prolonged slump in economic activity. Consumer and business confidence remain strong; a push for infrastructure expansion supports investment; capacity utilisation remains high; monthly trade data show a sharp pick-up in exports in October,” Fitch said.\nIt projects the economy to grow 6.4 percent in the current fiscal.\nOn prices front, it kept India’s inflation forecast unchanged at 4 percent and upped the FY27 forecast to 4.3 percent from the 4 percent projected earlier.\nFitch is more optimistic about rate cuts as well as inflation inches lower towards the RBI’s 4 percent target. It expects rates to settle at 5.75 percent by the end of FY26 and no cuts by FY27 end.\nIn its December update, the rating agency had projected 6.25 percent rate for FY26 and 6 percent for FY27 end.\n“The RBI began loosening policy in early February with a 25bp cut in the repo rate to 6.25 percent. We expect two further cuts in the policy rate this (calendar) year, so that the policy rate will be 5.75 percent by December 2025 (revised down from 6.25 percent in the last GEO),” it said.\nEconomists expect RBI to deliver two consecutive rate cuts in April and June meetings.\nOn the global front, Fitch lowered growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points to 2.3 percent compared with 2.9 percent in 2024.\n“Our latest economic forecasts assume a 15 percent Effective Tariff Rate (ETR) will be imposed on Europe, Canada, Mexico, and others in 2025, and 35 percent on China. This will push the US ETR to 18 percent this year before moderating to 16 percent next year as the ETR on Canada and Mexico falls to 10 percent. This would be highest rate for 90 years,” it said.\n“Modelling suggests tariff increases will reduce GDP by about 1pp in the US, China, and Europe by 2026,” Fitch further added.\nThe US has already levied tariffs on steel and aluminium products.

While valuations are not overly expensive from both an absolute and relative perspective, the global growth slowdown remains a concern, particularly regarding its indirect impact on India rather than direct tariff-related shocks.\nSpeaking to CNBC-TV18, the analysts noted that tariffs could pose a short-term shock in early April. However, they anticipate that ongoing bilateral talks may help mitigate their impact. The earnings downgrade cycle for financials, which has persisted for the past year, appears to be stabilizing, though UBS maintains earnings estimates lower than the broader consensus.\nBanking poised for recovery\nFor the banking sector, margins are likely to be affected by repo rate cuts. However, UBS sees valuations in the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI) space as reasonable. The second half of FY26 could potentially mark a recovery in the sector, supported by improving earnings. With a low base in FY25, a double-digit earnings growth projection for FY26 appears reasonable, they added.\nDespite these expectations, ground-level data has yet to reflect a full economic recovery, and liquidity remains tight. The advance tax cycle could exert further pressure, and analysts caution that credit growth typically lags behind economic recovery.\nPockets of opportunities\nUBS sees select opportunities in PSU utilities, defence, and financial stocks. While they do not expect broad-based thematic moves across the market, they believe individual stocks within sectors will differentiate themselves in this phase of the bull market.\nAdditionally, the analysts pointed to the communications and wireless (C&W) sector, which, following recent corrections, appears attractive. However, they caution that any disruption by new entrants in the sector could impact incumbent players.\nConsumption and Industrials take centerstage\nWhile it is too early to declare a full-fledged bull market return, UBS remains positive on consumption and select industrials. As market sentiment stabilises, sector-specific opportunities and policy-driven tailwinds will play a crucial role in shaping the next phase of growth.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

As share price rises on fresh buying, bears may rush to cover their short bets, triggering a rally as the market opens on Monday.\nOn Saturday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said IndusInd Bank's financial health remains \"stable\" and that it was \"closely monitoring\" the same. Analysts said after the RBI statement they expect the bank's cash counter to see more bargain hunting by wealthy clients and family offices and the derivatives counter to witness added short-covering by punters.\n\"Family offices, HNIs and other institutional players are allocating a portion of their funds to IndusInd Bank as part of their risk strategy, given the magnitude of the price fall,\" said Ambareesh Baliga, an independent market analyst.\nAlso read | IndusInd Bank flags lapses worth ₹1,530 crore in derivatives portfolio\nIndusInd Bank shares have plunged 57% from a 52-week high of ₹1576.35 on 8 April, 2024 to ₹672.35 on Thursday. Markets were closed for Holi on Friday.\nBargain hunting\nBaliga said that for some investors, it made \"sense to allocate a part of their risk \" to IndusInd after the huge fall. The RBI statement of the bank being \"well-capitalized\" could result in further bargain hunting in the cash market and short-covering in derivatives, which could support a further recovery in prices from Tuesday's low of ₹606.\nBears flocked to IndusInd after its derivatives accounting lapse surfaced last week. Though some of the massive cumulative bearish active futures positions of 57.75 million shares created on Tuesday were covered by Thursday, the cumulative outstanding futures positions remain high at 48.18 million shares as of that day, NSE data showed.\nExchanges have barred fresh positions in IndusInd derivatives since last Wednesday after the stock's cumulative open positions crossed the marketwide position limit (MWPL) set by stock exchanges. As of Thursday, open positions of all futures and options contracts on IndusInd stood at 143.87 million shares against the MWPL of 120.8 million shares . Unless the stock falls well below MWPL, it will remain in ban for fresh trades.\nAlso read | Can IndusInd Bank overcome governance woes and market uncertainty?\nRecovery\nThe RBI statement came after the stock's NSE cash counter saw huge delivery volumes across two days. While Tuesday's selloff witnessed deliveries hitting a one-year high of 31.9 million shares, Wednesday's delivery of 14.28 million shares a day later was the highest in almost five months.\nThe combined effect of cash buying at lower levels and derivatives short-covering has helped the stock recover 11% from a 52-week low of ₹606 on Tuesday through Thursday's closing of ₹672.35. The recovery could continue for now.\n\"The recovery might continue with likely short-covering and bargain hunting, provided that no fresh negative surprise hits the counter,\" explained Shrikant Chouhan, head of research (private client group) at Kotak Securities.\nChouhan said the \"silver lining\" in the issue was the bank disclosing the derivatives' accounting issue before the March quarter results. He added that the Street could, subject to no further negative surprises, begin pricing in the one-time hit to IndusInd Bank's net worth.\nAlso read | Mint Explainer: How IndusInd Bank slipped up on foreign currency hedging\nAfter the recent drawdown, IndusInd Bank is available cheaper than other lenders like Yes Bank and IDBI Bank, added Chouhan.

Book value of a company refers to the what shareholders would get if the company were liquidated today .\nMargin funding rises\nAs the IndusInd stock plunged, investors also scooped up IndusInd shares through margin trading, which enables an investor to leverage the purchase by up to four times. The total amount financed under margin trading facility by all brokers rose to ₹409 crore on Wednesday from ₹343 crore on Monday, per NSE.\nAlso read | IndusInd Bank promoter Ashok Hinduja backs MD, says balance sheet remains strong\nBuying under margin trading, where an investor pays only a minimum margin to buy a stock with the rest being financed by her broker against interest, signals that investors are leveraging themselves as they sense \"an opportunity of making quick returns in the short term,\" said Sudhir Joshi, consultant, Khambatta Securities.", "text_len": 4976}

Agriculture has also significantly contributed to growth, benefiting from above-average monsoon rains that enhanced Kharif crop production.\n\"For 1Q25, we expect a further pick-up in GDP growth, which would be consistent with GDP growth of 6.3 percent for the full financial year ending 31 March 2025 (FY24-25),\" Fitch added.\nThe report also said that business confidence remains robust, with lending surveys indicating continued double-digit growth in bank lending to the private sector. Furthermore, the Union Budget's allocation for sustained high levels of public capital expenditure is expected to have a broadly neutral impact on growth.\nFitch anticipates a rise in capital spending in FY25-26 and FY26-27, driven by various factors, including a reduction in capital costs following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) rate cuts. Consumer confidence has dipped slightly in recent months, with vehicle sales experiencing a notable decline. However, lower inflation rates are expected to enhance real incomes, while government and PMI survey data indicate steady employment growth.\nAdditionally, increased tax-free income and revised tax brackets are projected to boost post-tax incomes, thereby supporting higher consumer spending and overall growth. Net exports have positively impacted GDP growth this year due to robust export growth and declining imports. Fitch expects this trend to stabilize, with net exports' contribution to growth becoming broadly neutral in FY25-26 and FY26-27.\nConsumer price inflation decreased to 3.6 percent in February from 4.3 percent in January, as food price inflation receded from recent peaks. The report anticipates that food price dynamics will facilitate a gradual decline in the headline inflation rate to 4.0 percent by the year's end.\nMoreover, Fitch predicts a mild increase in inflation to 4.3 percent by December 2026, coinciding with the RBI's rate cuts.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 3216}

To address this, the bank has engaged PwC as an external advisor to conduct a thorough review, identify root causes, and assess the mark-to-market losses. The review is expected to be completed within three months.\nMoody’s expects the near-term impact on profitability and capital to be manageable but emphasized that the lack of effective internal controls remains a significant credit concern.\nAdding to the challenges, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved the reappointment of IndusInd’s Managing Director and CEO for only one year, instead of the three-year term proposed by the bank’s board. Additionally, the recent resignation of the CFO has raised further governance concerns.\nIndusInd’s asset quality is under pressure due to slowing economic growth and rising debt levels among retail borrowers. The bank’s gross non-performing loans (NPL) ratio increased to 2.3% by December 2024, up from 1.9% in March 2024, with microfinance and credit card segments seeing the most stress. Moody’s anticipates further NPL deterioration but expects proactive provisioning to mitigate profitability and capital impacts.\nDespite these challenges, Moody’s remains confident in IndusInd’s funding and liquidity stability, citing its strong domestic franchise and access to international funding sources as key factors supporting financial resilience.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

The agency emphasized that Bajaj Finance's stable earnings, strong asset quality, and consistent access to low-cost funding will continue to support its credit profile.\n\"Bajaj Finance's adequate underwriting standards and its largely mass-affluent borrower profile temper the risk of its concentration in unsecured consumer lending, which is inherently higher-risk,\" S&P noted.\nS&P has also raised credit ratings on Muthoot Finance to BB+. The stable rating outlook on Muthoot reflects S&P's view that the company will maintain its capitalization and strong market position in gold loans over the next 12 months. While S&P expects some stress in asset quality of Muthoot's microfinance subsidiary, it is expected to maintain overall asset quality, thanks to the dominance of its highly collateralized gold loan portfolio.\nS&P also upgraded Shriram Finance to BB+ and noted that the company will maintain its market leadership in the used-commercial vehicles market. The rating agency expects Shriram Finance to improve its credit cost marginally to 1.9% over the next couple of years from currently 2.1%.\n\"Shriram Finance's non-performing loans and credit costs will stay higher than those of peers because the company's borrowers have weak financial health and often do not have steady cash flows,\" S&P said.\nThe rating for Sammaan Capital has been revised to B+ keeping in mind the company's asset-light business model focusing on the origination and sale of loans, its repayments of legacy mortgage loans, and a rapid reduction in developer loans.\n\"We expect the company's capitalisation to remain stronger than most rated peers, mainly benefitting from the declining developer loan book, recent capital issuances, and improving profitability amid limited dividend payouts over the next 24 months,\" S&P noted.\nS&P noted that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) differentiated regulatory regime is expected to benefit upper-layer financial companies the most. RBI introduced scale-based regulations in October 2022 with a view to progressively increase the intensity of regulation and supervision. These are based on parameters such as companies' size, complexity, and interconnectedness.\n\"The scale-based regulations have progressively strengthened the financial system's stability, and have led to more sustainable growth at the largest NBFCs, along with a focus on risk management, transparency, and compliance,\" S&P said. \"The upper-layer NBFCs have become sizable, with total assets and loans rivaling those of midsize Indian banks.\"\nS&P has revised the anchor--the starting point for rating upper-layer financial companies in India--to 'bb+' from 'bb'.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.", "text_len": 3551}

Key Reasons Behind The Sensex Rally On March 20\nStock Market Rally Explained: The rally can be attributed to several factors, including domestic data, global cues, and stock-specific developments\nWhy Is The Market Rising Today? Benchmark Indian equity indices extended their upward momentum and closed with gains of over 1%, driven by broad-based buying across sectors. The 30-share Sensex ended at 76,348.06, up 899.01 points, or 1.19%, trading within a range of 76,456.25 to 75,684.58.\nSimilarly, the Nifty50 also ended higher, gaining 283.05 points, or 1.24%, to close at 23,190.65. The index reached an intraday high of 23,216.70 and dipped to a low of 22,973.95 during the session.\nRecommended Stories\nLeading the gains in the Nifty pack were Titan, Eicher Motors, Bharti Airtel, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, and Bajaj Auto, all rising nearly 4%. On the flip side, Bajaj Finance, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise, Bajaj Finserv, UltraTech Cement, and IndusInd Bank were among the top laggards.\nThe rally can be attributed to several factors, including positive domestic data, improving global cues, and stock-specific developments. However, the primary driver was the US Federal Reserve’s policy decision, which provided a significant boost to Indian IT stocks.\nInvestor Optimism on Fed’s Decision\nThe optimism surrounding today’s market rally stems from the Fed’s policy decision and its outlook. Despite projecting higher inflation and slower growth, the Fed’s indication of two rate cuts in 2025 fueled investor confidence.\nPrashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research) at Mehta Equities Ltd, commented, “The Federal Reserve’s decision to keep the funds rate steady at 4.25%-4.5% while signaling two rate cuts in 2025 has encouraged positive market sentiment.\"\nVikas Jain, Head of Research at Reliance Securities, added that the global momentum following the Fed’s announcement is likely to support the Indian market’s upward trajectory.\nBargain Buying and Valuation Comfort\nAfter a sharp correction from peak levels, investors are finding comfort in current valuations, which have become more attractive. Pankaj Pandey, Head of Research at ICICI Securities, noted, “With recent price corrections, valuations are more reasonable, and the domestic macroeconomic indicators remain largely positive.\"\nEmkay Global observed that much of the valuation froth has subsided, with most indices, including small and mid-caps, now trading below their long-term average P/E ratios.\nPositive Macroeconomic Data\nRecent macroeconomic data has eased concerns about slowing growth, further supporting market sentiment. India’s GDP grew by 6.2% in Q3FY25, retail inflation dropped to 3.61% in February from 4.26% in January, and the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw a growth of 5% in January, up from 3.2% the previous month.\nExpectations for RBI Rate Cuts\nWith inflation easing, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to cut rates in its upcoming April meeting. Madhavi Arora, Lead Economist at Emkay Global Financial Services, stated, “With inflation under control, the possibility of an RBI rate cut in April looks solid, and there may be one more cut to follow.\"\nHopes for Earnings Revival\nLooking ahead, markets are anticipating an earnings revival from Q1FY26, which could trigger another rally in the domestic market. According to analysts, India’s earnings growth is projected to be 12-14% over the next 12 months, with potential acceleration in 2027.\nBrokerage firm Emkay Global forecasts that the Nifty’s earnings per share growth of 13.6% has minimal downside risk, driven by a recovery in discretionary consumption.\nIT Stocks Rise\nIT stocks with US exposure surged, lifting market sentiment.\nInfosys, HCL Technologies, LTIMindtree, TCS, Tech Mahindra, Mphasis, Mastek, Coforge, KPIT Technologies, Birlasoft, and Sonata Software were among the top gainers on Thursday, as investors welcomed the US Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged following its policy meeting on March 19.\nThe positive movement in IT stocks lifted the Nifty IT index by nearly 1.3% to 36,699, marking its highest level in the past five sessions.\nWill the Rally Continue?\nKranthi Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities, remains optimistic about the market’s near-term outlook.\n“The market has navigated through numerous challenges, breaking past key resistance levels of 22,500-22,750,\" Bathini said. “With strong sentiment and an uptick in domestic liquidity, the Nifty has successfully reclaimed the 23,000 mark, which bodes well for the short to medium term.\"\nThe Nifty50 crossed the 23,000 threshold in early trading and is expected to close above this level, signaling a positive technical outlook for investors.", "text_len": 4763}

We shall place all accounts before the employees. You decide how much to spend on what and what payments we can withhold,” he said.\nStating that the government employees were fully legitimate in their demand for asking dearness allowance, Revanth Reddy said his government is in a helpless situation even to pay salaries to the employees on the first day of every month.\n“I request the employees not to insist on the DA arrears for now in view of the present difficult financial situation. When we become sick, we control our food intake and follow strict diet norms. Similarly, when the state financial position is sick, the employees should defer their demands for some time,” he said, adding even if the government wants to sell assets to pay DA arrears, it won’t be sufficient.\nBharat Rashtra Samithi working president and former minister KT Rama Rao hit out at Revanth Reddy. “The chief minister himself has admitted that the revenue to the state have come down in the last one year.

It said all derivatives must be marked to market (MTM), which requires valuing assets and liabilities according to prevailing market price. Even though the circular became effective from April 1, 2024-and there was no requirement to book the losses in the 2023-24 balance-sheet-what held back the bank from reporting the losses in the June, September or December quarters of 2024? While derivative accounting is complex, it couldn't have taken a year for IndusInd and its auditors to sense the jolt and come clean about it.\nWhat caused the losses?\nFor years, as IndusInd mobilised deposits in dollars (and Yen) and cut deals to hedge the risks arising from exchange rate fluctuations, two departments of the bank followed different accounting rules. One showed upfront profits while the other staggered the losses over a period, said senior bankers and former officials who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. This generated a net gain. Once the RBI 2023 directive stopped this practice, losses which were deferred, thanks to the hitherto permitted accounting norms, suddenly piled up.\nHere's how it worked. Suppose the bank raised $100 worth of deposits at X%, a floating rate linked to the dollar, when the USD/INR exchange rate was 80. Since the bank lends in INR, and must pay back the depositor $100, it covers against a weaker INR. For this, the Liability Desk, which mobilised the deposit, passes on the forex risk to the Treasury Desk. This transaction is the 'internal hedge'. The instrument used is called a cross-currency interest rate derivative. The Treasury then does a corresponding 'external hedge', by striking a foreign currency swap deal with another bank. With this swap, the Treasury hedges the forex and the rate risks on the interest as well as the $100 principal amount.\nSuppose the treasury hedged at 81 a dollar-meaning even if INR declines to 90, it can still buy USD at 81. A year later, when the USD surged to 88, the Treasury showed an MTM gain of ₹7 (88 minus 81) under MTM accounting. Ideally, the Liability Desk should show a loss of ₹8 (88 minus 80), as it had raised $100 when USD/INR was 80. But it doesn't as the liability desk does not follow MTM accounting.\nInstead, it follows accrual accounting, which allowed it to spread out the losses. For instance, for a 4-year $100 deposit, the liability desk books only a loss of ₹2 in the first year. Since the liability desk's loss for 4 years is ₹8, for each year it accounts for a loss of ₹2-postponing the reporting of the balance ₹6 loss for the remaining three years. With this, the bank shows a net gain of ₹5 (the difference between the Treasury's gain of ₹7 and the liability desk's loss of ₹2). If the Liability Desk had also adopted MTM accounting (and considered the full loss of ₹8 in the first year itself), the bank would have reported a net loss of ₹1 (the difference between Treasury's gain of ₹7 and the Liability Desk's MTM loss of ₹8). Instead, it shows a gain of ₹5. So, for a deposit of $1 million, the bank books an MTM gain of ₹50 lakh (in this example).\nIs it therefore all about gaps in the accounting rule book?\nYes, and no. Since 2015-16, the guidance given by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) says derivatives should be valued at MTM. If the bank and its auditors had adopted this, there wouldn't have been any accrual accounting by the liability desk, and IndusInd shareholders would have been spared. But any ICAI guidance, though a framework for auditors, is only recommendatory in nature. It's not mandatory, even though an auditor may have to explain why it didn't follow it. While the bank was free to pick any accounting rule, it could have followed a single rule for both desks (either MTM or accrual) as a consistent governance practice. But following different rules generated MTM profits and pushed back accrual losses.\nInterestingly, in June 2019, RBI had said that ICAI valuation standards should be followed for Rupee Interest Rate derivatives, but was silent about adopting MTM for forex derivatives. That came after 4 years.\nHas IndusInd unwound the internal derivative deals?\nIt's unclear. Was it in 2024-25? Which quarters? Did some of it happen before March 2024? Once a derivative which shows an MTM loss is unwound, the book losses crystallise into actual losses. (IndusInd did not respond to ET's queries on whether some of the internal derivative deals are still on its books or why weren't the losses reported earlier.)\nHow did divergent accounting escape the glare of multiple gatekeepers?\nA bank's book is scanned by statutory auditor, internal auditor and concurrent auditor, apart from RBI inspectors who spend weeks going through the numbers and minutes of meetings of asset-liability committee (ALCO). Did the auditors ever raise a red flag? What do the RBI inspection reports say? These questions need to be answered by the bank and regulators for greater transparency and improving trust in the banking system.\n(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.

That is where Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) come in. They offer loans just like banks but operate under different rules. Regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and registered under the Companies Act, 1956, NBFCs help people and businesses get the funds they need without the rigid requirements of traditional banks.\nTable of Contents\nAn NBFC personal loan is a loan given by NBFCs that do not hold an RBI-issued banking licence. NBFCs have the legal right to approve loans and launch credit facilities for debtors. Some NBFCs also offer retirement planning assistance to people.\nNBFC loans are a good option for people who may not qualify for bank loans due to lower credit scores or lack of extensive documentation.\nNBFCs cater to different financial needs. Some specialise in vehicle and machinery loans (asset financing companies), while others focus on personal and business loans (loan companies). There are also infrastructure finance companies for big projects, microfinance institutions for small loans to low-income groups and housing finance companies that deal with home loans.\nMoneycontrol has teamed up with eight lenders to offer fast, fully digital loans up to Rs 50 lakhs. The application process is easy to follow: enter your details, complete the KYC verification and choose an EMI plan. Interest rates can start as low as 10.5% percent per annum, depending on your employment status.\nUnlike traditional banks, NBFCs often don’t have strict eligibility criteria for specific loans. Instead of focusing heavily on credit scores, they prioritise your income potential. This makes it easier for individuals with lower credit scores (around 600-650) to get loan approval.\nIn contrast, the eligibility criteria set by banks remain quite stringent. Unlike NBFCs, banks check for stable income and a strong credit history, which is supposed to be over 700.\nIf you are applying for a loan with an NBFC, there is no need to submit any documents if you are an existing or pre-approved customer. If you are a new customer, the documents are limited to just KYC, bank account statements and the latest salary slips.\nWhen it comes to taking loans from banks, it is essential for both existing and new customers to submit lengthy paperwork. You also require additional documents for approving loans, like ID proof, salary slips, IT returns, bank statements and employment proofs.\nOne can get loans within a few minutes if they apply via NBFC. It is generally chosen if you need cash urgently. Pre-approved customers can get loans within a few minutes, and in some cases, unsecured loans are also approved within 5 minutes if applied from reputed NBFCs.\nBanks have a lengthy and slow approval process, usually taking 2–7 days for detailed verification.\nALSO READ: How to get a quick personal loan: Your essential guide for instant loan approval\nNBFCs offer lower amounts compared to banks but more flexibility in the loan structure. The tenure ranges from six months to five years. Even if you need a small amount for your personal needs, you can get it via NBFCs.\nWhen it comes to banks, you need to apply for higher loan amounts, often up to Rs 50 lakhs and the tenure ranges from one to seven years depending on it.\nNBFCs charge higher interest rates, usually between 10 percent and 30 percent per annum. The rate depends on your credit score, income and loan amount. Whereas banks generally offer lower interest rates, ranging from 8 percent to 18 percent per annum, depending on your credit profile. Interest rates are linked to the repo rate and other RBI policies.\nMoneycontrol has partnered with seven lenders to provide you with quick, 100% digital loans up to Rs 50 lakhs. You can get the loan in three steps: enter your information, complete the KYC process, and set up an EMI term. Depending on your work status, interest rates can start as low as 10.5% per annum.\nIf you want lower interest rates and higher loan amounts, then banks are a better option. Banks typically offer competitive rates, especially for those with a strong credit score, ensuring a more secure lending environment.\nNBFCs could be a better choice if you need fast approval, flexible eligibility criteria and easy documentation. NBFCs tend to offer quicker loan processing and are more lenient when it comes to credit score requirements, making them ideal for people with urgent cash needs or less-than-perfect credit.\nALSO READ: How to Compare Personal Loan Offers?\nTo conclude, NBFCs and banks both offer loans, but the right choice depends on your needs.\nShare it in your circle\nTable of Contents\nExplore Top Lenders for Instant Loan upto\nGet Instant Loan up to ₹50 Lakhs with Zero Paperwork from Top Lenders", "text_len": 4809}

Carney’s challenges, of course, differ. They’re so steep, he has the world’s attention.\nMark Carney, sworn in as the 24th Prime Minister of Canada on Friday, is a newbie in the world of politics. But then, so was the late Manmohan Singh, till former Prime Minister Narasimha Rao made him our finance minister in 1991.\nIndeed, the parallels between the paths taken by Singh and Carney are uncanny.\nAlso Read: The understated leadership of Manmohan Singh was rare and inspirational\nBoth pursued higher studies in Economics at Oxford University and went on to get their doctorate degree from Nuffield College: Singh in the early 1960s and Carney in the early 1990s. In age, they’re 33 years apart. Both served as the heads of their respective central banks. Manmohan Singh was the 15th governor of the Reserve Bank of India (1982-85). Carney, the head of two central banks, was the eighth governor of the Bank of Canada (2008-2013) and then the 120th governor of the Bank of England (2013-2020), the first non-Briton in its history of more than three centuries to lead it.\nWhile Singh came from India’s Planning Commission to head RBI, Carney served as deputy governor in the Bank of Canada before returning to head it after a brief stint as senior associate deputy minister at the department of finance. Carney worked in the private sector—at Goldman Sachs—while Singh was an out-and-out public-sector man.\nAs central bank heads, both faced challenging times. Singh oversaw the transition from a very regimented system to a more market-friendly one through comprehensive legal reforms of banking. Carney had to deal with the global financial crisis while heading Canada’s central bank and then with the fallout of Brexit and the early years of covid during his tenure at Britain’s.\nThat’s not all.\nAlso Read: Montek Singh Ahluwalia on Manmohan Singh: A wise, gentle and persuasive leader who made a huge difference\nTheir political careers were more accidental than planned, earning one of them, Singh, the sobriquet ‘accidental PM.’ But for Donald Trump’s election victory in the US and his outrageous call for Canada to become America’s 51st state, Carney would probably have remained a private citizen.\nLikewise, but for the elevation of Rao as the ninth PM of India, Singh might have returned to his first love, academia. As Singh reportedly told journalist Mark Tully in 2005, “On the day [that Rao] was formulating his cabinet, he sent his principal secretary to me saying, ‘The PM would like you to become the minister of finance.’ I didn’t take it seriously. [Rao] eventually tracked me down the next morning, rather angry, and demanded that I get dressed up and come to Rashtrapati Bhavan for the swearing-in. So that’s how I started in politics.\"\nBut there are differences as well.\nAlso Read: Justin Trudeau is leaving a job no one seems to want, except Mark Carney\nSingh was a seasoned 71 when he became PM, Carney has just turned 60. When Singh took over as India’s PM in 2004, he did not have to worry about elections. The Congress Party was in the driver’s seat, albeit in a coalition government. Although Singh remained a Rajya Sabha member throughout his political career (his sole attempt to win a Lok Sabha seat in 1999 ended in defeat), he could get down to work immediately.\nIn contrast, Carney has to face elections, expected to be called soon. Worse, he must lead his country through one of its toughest challenges yet—an escalating trade war with its biggest trading partner, the US.\nManmohan Singh passed away in December 2024 and is now part of history. If his greatest achievement as FM was in seeing through reforms in a host of areas, his greatest contribution as PM was perhaps the India-US Civil Nuclear Agreement that ended our pariah status among nuclear powers. As for Mark Carney, history is still in the making.", "text_len": 4059}

But the truly unfortunate are those who have greatness snatched away.\nTake Purshottamdas Thakurdas, the Gujarati cotton trader and industrialist from Bombay. Had the Indian government followed the blueprint set out in the Bombay Plan of 1944, Thakurdas might have been remembered as the architect of an economic revolution.\nRead this | Vikram Sarabhai, the cosmic capitalist whose vision encompassed Indian industry\nThe 15-year investment strategy, outlined in January 1944 and initially meant for private circulation, had the potential to set India on a vastly different economic trajectory. Thakurdas, who condensed it into two pamphlet-sized volumes and published them as A Brief Memorandum Outlining a Plan of Economic Development for India in 1945, could have been hailed as one of its founding fathers.\nInstead, the Indian government, in its wisdom, chose a different path—one that condemned the country to a miserly rate of growth, later derisively dubbed the \"Hindu rate of growth,\" for the first four decades of independence.\nThe other signatories of the almost-forgotten document—industrialists like J.R.D. Tata, G.D. Birla, Lala Shriram, and Kasturbhai Lalbhai, as well as public figures like A.D. Shroff and John Mathai—moved on to their primary vocations and earned their spurs in business and finance. Thakurdas, however, became a footnote.\nThis, despite his many achievements.\nBorn in May 1879 into a wealthy Gujarati bania family that had moved from Surat to Bombay, he lost his father at a young age. A kindly uncle raised him as his own, absorbing him into his cotton and oilseeds trading firm after he graduated from Elphinstone College and attained his law degree.\nThakurdas went on to become president of the East India Cotton Association and, in 1927, along with G.D. Birla, co-founded the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci). Historian Bipan Chandra, in India Wins Independence, notes that Ficci was part of the efforts to establish a national-level organization of Indian commercial, industrial, and financial interests, in contrast to the already well-organized European business lobbies in India.\nThough a die-hard nationalist, Thakurdas also earned the respect of the British, who conferred on him the titles of Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire and Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. Recognizing his meticulous attention to detail and sense of fair play, the colonial government appointed him to several committees, including one entrusted with apportioning public holidays among various Indian communities—a shrewd and calculated move.\nRead this | Cotton King Govindram Seksaria: The Marwari maven of pre-Independence trade\nIn his PhD thesis, The Politics of Moderation: Britain and the Indian Liberal Party 1917-1923, scholar Philip Graham Woods writes: “It was increasingly important for the British, therefore, not to alienate the ‘middle-ground’ of Indian economic interests, represented by industrialists like Purshottamdas Thakurdas and others.\"\nYet Thakurdas also enjoyed the confidence of the Indian National Congress, despite his well-articulated misgivings about Gandhi’s Civil Disobedience movement. His ability to command trust on both sides allowed him to arbitrate on key national issues. He pressed for a strong and autonomous central banking system, playing an influential role in the formative years of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). He was also a founding member of the Indian Institute of Banking & Finance (formerly the Indian Institute of Bankers) and served on its Council until his death on 4 July 1961.\nAs a successful businessman, Sir PT, as he was known, firmly believed in free enterprise and the power of market forces to allocate resources efficiently. Yet he was unlike the extractive capitalists who hijacked the economies of many newly independent nations.\nIn his authoritative biography of Thakurdas, Dom Moraes writes: “Despite their large stake in private enterprise, the Bombay planners, mainly under the initiative of Sir Purshotamdas, followed a middle course in the larger national context. Indeed, they conceded without reservation that the existing economic organization of the country, based on private enterprise and ownership, had failed to bring about a satisfactory distribution of national income.\"\nAlso read | How Manu Manek aka Black Cobra went from college trader to market marauder\nHistory may have relegated him to the margins of India's economic narrative, but in his commitment to both free enterprise and social welfare, Thakurdas charted a balanced path—one the country would eventually adopt decades later. It was a testament to the enduring wisdom of a man who saw far beyond his time.", "text_len": 4972}

Use them to gain an edge in the market.\nInvesting, like flying, is all about managing risk. And when things go wrong, the way an industry responds determines its long-term safety.\nThe recent IndusInd Bank saga brings to mind an important lesson from aviation—one that could help investors avoid financial turbulence.\nRead this | IndusInd Bank: A crucial crossroads amid leadership continuity and financial headwinds\nModern air travel is safer than ever, with just one fatal accident per 16 million flights. That’s not by chance. It’s because the aviation industry learns from its mistakes. Every aircraft is equipped with two black boxes—one that records mechanical data and another that captures cockpit conversations. When an accident happens, investigators analyze these black boxes to pinpoint the cause and implement corrective measures. More importantly, pilots are encouraged to report errors without fear of punishment, fostering a culture of transparency and improvement.\nThis approach, known as Black Box Thinking, helps aviation evolve. But in investing, such transparency is often lacking.\nTake IndusInd Bank. Recently, its chief executive attempted to address concerns about the bank’s governance lapses related to derivative transactions.\n“The treasury thing has been a big blow personally to me also, but I think it's a matter of time that the bank will come up, and I don't think there are any hidden skeletons in the cupboard, and we are not hiding any losses, or we are not hiding anything from the investors,\" CEO Sumant Kathpalia recently said in a media interaction.\nHe insisted that the bank was committed to transparency. Yet, regulatory actions suggest otherwise.\nIn December 2024, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a ₹2.7 million penalty on IndusInd Bank for violating deposit interest rate guidelines. The regulator found that the bank had opened savings accounts for ineligible parties, breaching established norms.\nAdding to its troubles, the RBI curtailed Kathpalia’s reappointment to just one year, rejecting the bank board’s proposal for a three-year term. The decision stemmed from the regulator’s dissatisfaction with IndusInd’s risk appraisal process.\nFurther compounding concerns, top management engaged in significant insider selling of shares of the bank in 2023 and 2024—a disclosure made through stock exchange filings.\nSo, what should investors take away from this?\nMuch like in aviation, where black box data helps prevent future accidents, investors should look for insider indicators that signal corporate governance risks. Here are seven key red flags that shouldn’t be ignored:\nUse of derivatives and risky financial instruments – Since the 2008 financial crisis, derivatives have been labeled “financial weapons of mass destruction.\" Companies that aggressively use them to boost profits should have their risk management policies scrutinized.\nRole of auditors – Auditors are supposed to flag financial irregularities, yet history shows they sometimes fail to do so—or even enable misconduct. In 2008, PwC was implicated in the Satyam Computers fraud, a massive corporate governance failure.\nA decade later, the same pattern emerged, with auditors resigning en masse rather than exposing frauds.\nBetween January and May 2018, 32 auditors resigned, a seemingly small number but significant given the reasons cited—which were not part of the usual audit contract cycle. Such resignations are often an early warning sign, particularly in small-cap companies.\nLack of transparency – A relentless pursuit of growth can push management to diversify into unrelated businesses, overleverage balance sheets, or make overpriced acquisitions—all at the cost of shareholder returns.\nInstead of acknowledging these risks, companies often downplay or outright deny poor capital allocation decisions. Investors should be wary of opaque disclosures, aggressive expansions, and questionable M&A activity.\nQuality of assets – At IndusInd Bank, marked-to-market (MTM) derivative losses lacked independent audits, highlighting a critical oversight gap. While internal scrutiny existed, external audits could have flagged potential issues in hedging positions and asset quality.\nRegular audits help detect early signs of financial stress. Without them, banks risk accumulating non-performing assets (NPAs)—which erode return on equity and diminish net worth. Poor asset quality is a red flag for long-term shareholder value destruction.\nSolvency – A deteriorating loan book affects a bank’s profitability, liquidity, and overall solvency. A sharp decline in capital adequacy ratio (CAR) can lead to regulatory restrictions on deposits, lending, and even cash withdrawals in extreme cases. Investors should monitor CAR trends to assess a bank’s financial resilience.\nPromoter pledging – While not illegal, excessive share pledging by promoters can be a red flag, especially in overleveraged firms. If the company defaults, pledged shares may be dumped into the market, causing a sharp price decline. This not only erodes investor value but also risks promoters losing control of the company.\nContingent liabilities – These off-balance-sheet obligations materialize only when a specific event occurs. While they may seem harmless, they can pose a serious financial threat if they represent a large portion of a company’s net worth. When triggered, they can wipe out substantial equity, leaving investors blindsided.\nIndividually, these indicators might not raise alarm bells. But when combined, they paint a clearer picture of a company’s financial health. Investors should carefully evaluate these insider signals before betting on a stock—especially one that appears to be a “value buy.\"\nIn conclusion, insider activities alone do not always signal weakness in a stock—insider selling, for instance, may simply reflect a promoter’s liquidity needs. However, the warning signs outlined here serve as a critical checklist for investors evaluating potential value buys.\nAlso read | IndusInd Bank bears may be about to get a whipping\nIf you're considering IndusInd Bank as a value investment, the key question is whether its net worth remains stable. Labelling it a deep value stock without thoroughly assessing its financials and regulatory scrutiny would be premature.\nMore importantly, companies with weak corporate governance often lose their premium valuation multiples for extended periods. Before jumping in, take a step back and check if the company’s governance history justifies its price.\nHappy investing.\nDisclaimer: This article is for information purposes only.

More can be done\nIndian banks are awash in money. In 2023, they held 103L cr – $1.2tn – in FDs alone. The small customer can seem too small from their vantage. So, kudos to RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra for speaking up for the little guy. On Monday, Malhotra rapped banks for poor customer service. Everybody’s had a taste of it, but data shows the full extent of the rot. Complaints received under RBI’s ombudsman scheme – not resolved by your bank, hence escalated to RBI – have grown at 50% a year for the past two years. If India’s GDP grew that fast, it would overtake US in just over 5 years. That’s why Malhotra called it a “highly unsatisfactory situation” that needs “urgent attention”. He also flagged the underreporting of complaints by banks. In 2023-24, India’s scheduled commercial banks together received over 1cr complaints, but it turns out they were window dressing data – many complaints were listed as requests, queries and disputes, which is a regulatory violation.\nIn simpler times, banking-related complaints were mostly about forgery and wrong entry, but complexity has broadened the gamut of problems. For example, on Wednesday TOI reported about a man in Gujarat whose credit score fell because of his bank’s mistake, making him ineligible for loans. Bank branches misselling investment schemes and other products like life insurance is another outrage. A few years ago, a report pointed out that bank branches rewarded staff for selling these products but not for better customer service.\nLast year, RBI raised concerns about gold loans. In Dec, it cautioned banks about unsecured loans, and top-up loans offered with minimum due diligence. Now, SC has sought a CBI probe into another old problem – the “nexus” between banks and builders due to which lakhs of homebuyers are paying EMIs without any hope of getting their house. As it told counsel for banks on Tuesday: “…knowing not a brick has been laid at the site, you released 60%. How can this be without quid pro quo?” Banks have much to answer, and fix. They should heed Malhotra’s warning: “Left unresolved, such issues can erode consumer confidence and tarnish the entire ecosystem.”\nThis piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Times of India.\nTop Comment\n{{A_D_N}}\n{{C_D}}\n{{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}}...

If a trade looks too good to be true, it probably is.\nAs it’s becoming painfully evident now, India’s 10-year-old sovereign gold bond program is just a $13 billion naked short position for the government, an albatross around its neck at a time when bullion prices have gone parabolic and show no sign of subsiding. It’s the taxpayers who are on the hook for paying that money to bondholders.\nThis wasn’t how the program was supposed to run. The special debt, it was decided, would pay a 2.75% coupon (reduced later to 2.5%), and the investment itself would be measured in grams of gold. Upon redemption eight years later, investors would be given the prevailing market value of the metal in rupee terms.\nAt least on paper, it all made sense. With the euro zone back from the brink of a messy breakup, the demand for safe havens was on its way down globally. Suppose someone bought 1 gram worth of the metal-linked bonds in November 2015 for a little over 2,500 rupees, which came to about $38 in those days. Even if New Delhi had to redeem the notes for 50% more — 3,750 rupees -- the borrowing cost would still be less than the near-8% yield on regular government debt.\nThere were other advantages. To the extent people would be drawn to the financial product, they would be less keen to buy the physical asset, saving India some of the $30 billion in hard currency that it had spent annually over the previous decade on imports of the precious metal.\nHowever, nearly every one of those assumption came a cropper. First, international prices zoomed — from just about $1,500 an ounce in late 2019 to $3,000 now. The very first bond matured at more than double its issue price, making it a costly form of borrowing. Two, the popular craze for bullion never really went away even as it became more expensive. Average annual imports have stood at $37 billion over the past 10 years. To nip this demand, New Delhi raised customs duties to 15% in 2022.\nThat little maneuver also backfired. It boosted the domestic price, further ballooning the government’s outgo on maturing bonds. New Delhi panicked. Last year, it slashed import tariffs to 6%.\nBut that was before the US elections in November. With Donald Trump in the White House, the value of the world’s preferred inflation hedge is going through the roof amid fears of what his tariffs would do to consumer prices. This week, a bond sold in March 2017 was redeemed for more than 8,600 rupees, or three times the issue price of the 1 gram note. Investors “have hit a jackpot,” the Economic Times noted.\nAlso Read: Investors hit jackpot with SGB, gain 3x on gold bond redemption at Rs 8,624 per gram\nTaxpayers have come up snake eyes, though. Do the math. The government sold bonds worth 147 tons in 67 tranches. As of last month, New Delhi was still on the hook for 132 tons, which translates to a liability of 1.2 trillion rupees ($13 billion) at current prices. The last bond will only retire in February 2032. Who knows what the commodity will cost seven years from now.\nIf the current frenzy in market prices proves durable, large losses are almost guaranteed. Some analysts have noted that the central bank’s gold — 879 tons last month — offers a natural hedge. But the Reserve Bank of India has acquired those quantities to diversify the base of safe assets backing its liabilities: the domestic money supply. They were never meant to backstop the government’s borrowing.\nAlready, the share of the precious metal in the RBI’s foreign-exchange reserves has risen to 11.5%, the highest on record, according to the World Gold Council. If the market gets the sense that they are being amassed to pay off creditors in the future, it will raise difficult questions about the institution’s independence.\nThe whole thing is an avoidable mess. India has thrown in the towel, and discontinued fresh issuances of the bonds. But that was only after it took in 270 billion rupees during the fiscal year that ended last March, the most in the program’s truncated history.\nIndians’ love of the yellow metal is coded in their DNA, for reasons that have as much to do with culture as economic security. For many families, especially in rural areas, it is the only asset they can pledge in a pinch. Adding to the sheen, it’s the country’s best-performing investment so far this year, a cushion against brutal losses in the stock market. It was valiant of the government to try to tamp the popular impulse for hoarding gold, but reckless of it to mount an unhedged bet against a basic instinct.\n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

Will these be sufficiently liquid in the wider market? And can India assure investors of the sustained economic stability needed to generate demand?\nLife Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) wants the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to issue sovereign bonds with a 100-year tenure. The state-run insurer’s chief Siddhartha Mohanty has said that LIC is in discussions with RBI on the idea.\nAlso Read: The case for granting autonomy to state-run listed entities. Starting with LIC\nFor an insurer, such long bonds can be assets that outlast the long-term liabilities that arise from its life-span coverage of policyholders. But such bonds must also be reasonably liquid, or easy to sell in the wider bond market.\nAlso Read: RBI cut repo rate in Feb. Why did it take so long for banks to reduce interest rates?\nTo be sure, RBI began issuing 40-year government bonds in 2015 and also had a successful 50-year issue in 2023. Pension funds, insurers and other institutions with long liabilities find these useful as investments. But a 100-year bond may turn out to be a stretch too far.\nLong bonds are held on the assumption of sustained policy stability. The real value of the money invested must hold largely steady. So inflation, interest rates and their drivers (like fiscal deficits) must stay within limits. Else, those bonds would lose market value.\nAlso Read: Mint Quick Edit | Inflation: In RBI’s control at last?\nGiven how hard it is to assure investors of that, a market for 100-year bonds won’t be easy to create. And issuance for a single subscriber is unwise. First, India should test the depth of demand for shorter-tenure long bonds.", "text_len": 1774}

To ensure that liquidity remains surplus so that its rate cut can be transmitted to borrowers, the central bank plans to inject another Rs 50,000 crore through bond repurchases on Tuesday.\nAlthough a 25-basis-point cut in repo rate in February brought relief to homebuyers, neither the cut nor the record liquidity has reduced cost of funds for corporate borrowers. This is because the interest rate for corporates depends on the one-year marginal cost of lending rates, which reflects that cost at which banks raise funds. The one-year MCLR for the country's top lender State Bank of India has been rock steady at 9% - the highest level since RBI started raising rates.\nWhile the central bank has undertaken record liquidity infusion, the reaction of money markets has been muted largely because of year-end demand for funds and the rise in yields globally. Banks are reluctant to reduce interest rates on term deposits because credit growth (9.5% until end-Feb) continues to outstrip deposit growth (8.8%).\nSince RBI reduce the repo rate no major bank has brought down its deposit rate. The lowering of FD rates has been done largely by some small finance banks who have been reassessing their growth targets given the stress in the sector. Currently there are seven small finance banks and four private banks offering over 8% rates on the fixed deposits.\nSecond, even as RBI infuses record liquidity, it continues to drain rupees out of the banking system by selling dollars from its forex reserves. This sale of dollars has helped stabilise the system and the liquidity measures have helped address immediate shortages, but they have not yet fully succeeded in reducing short-term interest rates due to ongoing liquidity deficits and economic uncertainties.\nWith the year-end pressure to lend, bankers say that cost of funds will decline in the first quarter of FY26.", "text_len": 2024}

Disbursals of housing finance fell by 20% in the Oct-Dec quarter of financial year 2024-25, dropping from Rs 18,967 crore in the corresponding period of the last financial year to Rs 15,211 crore, according to data from the State-Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) – Gujarat.\nBanking sector sources and real estate industry insiders attribute the dip to a number of factors including rising property prices, policy uncertainty, liquidity issues and shifting investor sentiment.\n\"The state govt's recent proposal of Jantri revision in Nov 2024 also led to a significant uncertainty in the market. Even though the Reserve Bank of India cut repo rates, boosting loan products, demand for housing finance remained sluggish. The proposed Jantri revision dampened sentiments in a big way,\" explained a senior official of SLBC – Gujarat, requesting anonymity.\nInterestingly, soon after the Covid-19 surge, Gujarat saw a rise in home buying, largely driven by middle-class investors who capitalised on tax benefits under the old tax regime. \"Many bought second homes, considering it a stable asset. However, with those benefits tapering off and new home price appreciation slowing down, the market seems to have reached a saturation point,\" the official added.\nReal estate sector has also faced competition from other asset classes offering quicker and higher returns, leading to a shift in investment patterns. As a result, even though banks and housing finance companies aggressively expanded their loan portfolios, actual demand remained relatively flat.\nWhile developers had initially expected a steady influx of buyers, many prospective homeowners are now hesitant, delaying purchases or exploring other investment options.\nA senior developer from CREDAI Gujarat said, \"There is a weak demand in the real estate market for the last some months. Overall liquidity crisis has increased, and it has affected real estate in a big way. Stock market correction has affected the demand in real estate significantly because a large number of investors are stuck in the market. Most buyers prefer ready to move properties and only established developers with proven track record get bookings for under construction projects while new developers and projects having a large number of partners are struggling to get bookings. Ahmedabad is comparatively in a better situation compared to other cities, but suburbs of Gandhinagar have seen huge drop in demand.\"\nWith no immediate stimulus in sight, the housing finance sector is expected to tread cautiously.\nBanking sector sources and real estate industry insiders attribute the dip to a number of factors including rising property prices, policy uncertainty, liquidity issues and shifting investor sentiment.\n\"The state govt's recent proposal of Jantri revision in Nov 2024 also led to a significant uncertainty in the market.
